Process called "fibonacci" that takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Calculate fibonacci number
    If n is less than or equal to 1:
        Return n
    End If
    
    Let a be fibonacci(n minus 1)
    Let b be fibonacci(n minus 2)
    Return a plus b
End Process

Process called "factorial" that takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Calculate factorial
    If n is less than or equal to 1:
        Return 1
    End If
    
    Return n multiplied by factorial(n minus 1)
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Main entry point
    Note: Test various computations
    
    Let fib5 be fibonacci(5)  Note: Should be 5
    Let fact4 be factorial(4)  Note: Should be 24
    
    Note: Return sum as exit code (5 + 24 = 29)
    Return fib5 plus fact4
End Process
