Note: Test that diagnostic_system can be imported by other components

Import module "core_libs" as Core
Import module "diagnostic_system" as Diag

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Verify diagnostic module can be imported and used
    
    Note: This simulates what other compiler components will do
    Note: Create diagnostic context (what compiler driver will do)
    Let context be Diag.create_diagnostic_context()
    
    Note: Create source location (what parser will do)  
    Let location be Diag.create_source_location("test.runa", 1, 1, 1)
    
    Note: Report error (what semantic analyzer will do)
    Let error be Diag.report_error(context, "E001", "Test error", location)
    
    Note: Check compilation continuation (what driver will do)
    Let can_continue be Diag.should_continue_compilation(context)
    
    Note: All operations completed successfully - diagnostic system is ready
    Return 0
