Type called "Symbol":
    name as String                       
    symbol_type as String               
    data_type as String                 
    scope_id as Integer                 
    line as Integer                     
    is_mutable as Boolean               
    metadata as String                  
End Type

Type called "Scope":
    scope_id as Integer                  
    parent_scope as Integer              
    symbols as Array                     
    scope_type as String                 
    start_line as Integer                
    end_line as Integer                  
End Type

Process called "create_simple_symbol" returns Symbol:
    Let test_symbol be Symbol with name as "test", symbol_type as "variable", data_type as "integer", scope_id as 0, line as 1, is_mutable as false, metadata as ""
    Return test_symbol
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let symbol be create_simple_symbol()
    Return 0
End Process
