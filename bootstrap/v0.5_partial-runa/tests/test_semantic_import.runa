Note: Test that semantic_analyzer can be imported by other components

Import module "core_libs" as Core
Import module "parser_frontend" as Parser
Import module "semantic_analyzer" as Semantic

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Verify semantic analyzer module can be imported and used
    
    Note: This simulates what other compiler components will do
    Note: Create simple AST to analyze
    Let tokens be Core.empty_list()
    Let token_stream be Parser.TokenStream with tokens as tokens, current_index as 0, source_file as "test.runa"
    
    Note: Create a simple AST representing "Let x be 42"
    Let literal_node be Parser.ASTNode with node_type as "Literal", children as Core.empty_list(), value as "42", start_token as Parser.Token with kind as "integer", value as "42", line as 1, column as 1, length as 2, end_token as Parser.Token with kind as "integer", value as "42", line as 1, column as 1, length as 2
    
    Let children be Core.empty_list()
    Core.array_push(children, literal_node)
    
    Let var_decl be Parser.ASTNode with node_type as "VariableDeclaration", children as children, value as "x", start_token as Parser.Token with kind as "keyword", value as "Let", line as 1, column as 1, length as 3, end_token as Parser.Token with kind as "integer", value as "42", line as 1, column as 10, length as 2
    
    Let program_children be Core.empty_list()
    Core.array_push(program_children, var_decl)
    
    Let program_ast be Parser.ASTNode with node_type as "Program", children as program_children, value as "", start_token as Parser.Token with kind as "keyword", value as "Let", line as 1, column as 1, length as 3, end_token as Parser.Token with kind as "integer", value as "42", line as 1, column as 10, length as 2
    
    Note: Perform semantic analysis (what type_system will do)
    Let semantic_result be Semantic.analyze_program(program_ast)
    
    Note: Create symbol table (what compiler_bridge will do)
    Let symbol_table be Semantic.create_symbol_table()
    
    Note: All operations completed successfully - semantic analyzer is ready
