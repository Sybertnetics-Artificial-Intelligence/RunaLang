Process called "test_conditional" returns Integer:
    Let x be 10
    If x is greater than 5:
        Print "x is greater than 5"
        Return 1
    End If

    Print "x is not greater than 5"
    Return 0
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Print "Testing control flow"
    Let result be test_conditional()

    If result is equal to 1:
        Print "Conditional test passed"
        Return 42
    End If

    Print "Conditional test failed"
    Return 1
End Process
