Note: This example demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Runa

Process called "add" that takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a + b
End Process

Process called "multiply" that takes x as Integer, y as Integer returns Integer:
    Return x * y
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let result1 be add(5, 3)
    Let result2 be multiply(result1, 2)
    Return result2
End Process
