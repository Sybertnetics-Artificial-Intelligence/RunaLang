Note: Test v0.2 assembly generation concepts using v0.1
Note: This demonstrates what v0.2 SHOULD generate as assembly

Process called main returns Integer:
    Note: Test basic arithmetic that v0.2 would generate as:
    Note:     mov $42, %rax
    Note:     mov $17, %rbx
    Note:     add %rbx, %rax
    Let x be 42
    Let y be 17
    Let result be x plus y

    Note: Test function call that v0.2 would generate as:
    Note:     call test_function
    Let call_result be test_function(result)

    Return call_result
End Process

Process called test_function that takes val as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: v0.2 would generate:
    Note: test_function:
    Note:     push %rbp
    Note:     mov %rsp, %rbp
    Note:     sub $256, %rsp
    Note:     ...function body...
    Note:     mov %rbp, %rsp
    Note:     pop %rbp
    Note:     ret
    Return val plus 1
