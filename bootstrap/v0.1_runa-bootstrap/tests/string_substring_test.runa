Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Testing string substring
    Let hello be "Hello World"
    Let substring be string_substring(hello, 0, 5)
    
    Note: Should extract "Hello" from "Hello World"
    Note: For now just return length to verify it worked
    Let len be string_length(substring)
    Return len
End Process
