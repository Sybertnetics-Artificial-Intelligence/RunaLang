Process called "main" that takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let a be 10
    Let b be 5
    
    Let sum be a + b
    Let diff be a - b
    Let product be a * b
    Let quotient be a / b
    
    Let complex be (a + b) * 2 - 10
    
    Return sum + diff + product + quotient + complex
End Process
