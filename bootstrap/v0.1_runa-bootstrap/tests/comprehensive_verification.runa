Process called "main" that takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Test 1: AND in Let statements
    Let a be 3
    Let b be 5
    Let test1 be a and b
    
    Note: Test 2: OR in Let statements
    Let c be 2
    Let d be 4
    Let test2 be c or d
    
    Note: Test 3: Bitwise operations work correctly
    Let e be 2
    Let f be 4
    Let test3 be e and f
    
    Note: Test 4: IF statements still work with AND
    Let test4 be 0
    If a and b:
        Set test4 to 10
    End If
    
    Note: Test 5: Complex expression with parentheses
    Let test5 be (a and b) + (c or d)
    
    Return test1 + test2 + test3 + test4 + test5
End Process
