Process called "main" that takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: This test verifies that comments work alongside all our features
    
    Note: === Arithmetic Operations ===
    Let x be 10
    Let y be 5
    Let sum be x + y
    Note: sum = 15
    
    Note: === Comparison Operations === 
    Let test1 be 0
    If x is greater than y:
        Note: This should execute since 10 > 5
        Set test1 to 1
    End If
    
    Note: === Boolean Operations (Bitwise) ===
    Let a be 3
    Let b be 5
    Let and_result be a and b
    Note: 3 & 5 = 1 (binary: 011 & 101 = 001)
    
    Note: === Complex Expression ===
    Let result be sum + test1 + and_result
    Note: Expected: 15 + 1 + 1 = 17
    
    Return result
