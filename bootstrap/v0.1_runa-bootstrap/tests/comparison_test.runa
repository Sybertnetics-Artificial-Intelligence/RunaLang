Process called "main" that takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let a be 10
    Let b be 5
    Let c be 10
    
    Let eq_test be 0
    If a is equal to c:
        Set eq_test to 1
    End If
    
    Let neq_test be 0
    If a is not equal to b:
        Set neq_test to 1
    End If
    
    Let gt_test be 0
    If a is greater than b:
        Set gt_test to 1
    End If
    
    Let lt_test be 0
    If b is less than a:
        Set lt_test to 1
    End If
    
    Let gte_test be 0
    If a is greater than or equal to c:
        Set gte_test to 1
    End If
    
    Let lte_test be 0
    If b is less than or equal to a:
        Set lte_test to 1
    End If
    
    Return eq_test + neq_test + gt_test + lt_test + gte_test + lte_test
End Process
