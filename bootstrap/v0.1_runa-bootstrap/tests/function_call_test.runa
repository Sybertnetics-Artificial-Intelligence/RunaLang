Process called "add" that takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a + b
End Process

Process called "multiply" that takes x as Integer, y as Integer returns Integer:
    Return x * y
End Process

Process called "compute" that takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    Let sum be add(n, 10)
    Let product be multiply(sum, 2)
    Return product
End Process

Process called "main" that takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result1 be add(5, 3)
    Let result2 be multiply(4, 7)
    Let result3 be compute(10)

    Note: result1 = 5 + 3 = 8
    Note: result2 = 4 * 7 = 28
    Note: result3 = compute(10) = (10 + 10) * 2 = 40
    Note: Total = 8 + 28 + 40 = 76

    Return result1 + result2 + result3
End Process
