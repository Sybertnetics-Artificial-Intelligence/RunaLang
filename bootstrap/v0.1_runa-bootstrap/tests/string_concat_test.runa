Process called "main" that takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let str1 be "Hello"
    Let str2 be " World"
    Let result be str1 + str2
    
    Let len be string_length(result)
    
    Note: "Hello" + " World" = "Hello World" which has 11 characters
    Return len
End Process
