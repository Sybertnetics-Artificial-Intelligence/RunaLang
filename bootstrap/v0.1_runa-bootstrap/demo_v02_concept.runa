Note: Demonstration of v0.2 Self-Hosting Concept
Note: This shows the key breakthrough - v0.1 can parse v0.2 syntax

Process called main that takes args as List[String] returns Integer:
    Note: This syntax was impossible for v0.1 to parse before today
    Note: List[String] - generic type syntax ✅ NOW WORKING
    Note: length of args - natural language expressions ✅ NOW WORKING
    Note: args at index 1 - collection access syntax ✅ NOW WORKING

    If length of args is greater than 0:
        Let first_arg be args at index 0
        Note: In a full implementation, this would call:
        Note: Let tokens be Lexer_tokenize(first_arg)
        Note: Let ast be Parser_parse(tokens)
        Note: Let assembly be CodeGen_generate(ast)
        Return 42
    Otherwise:
        Return 0
    End If
End Process
