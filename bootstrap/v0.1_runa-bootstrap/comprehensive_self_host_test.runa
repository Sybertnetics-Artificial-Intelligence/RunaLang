Process called "factorial" that takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    If n is equal to 0:
        Return 1
    End If

    Let previous be factorial(n - 1)
    Let result be n * previous
    Return result
End Process

Process called "fibonacci" that takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    If n is equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If

    If n is equal to 1:
        Return 1
    End If

    Let a be fibonacci(n - 1)
    Let b be fibonacci(n - 2)
    Let result be a + b
    Return result
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Print "Comprehensive self-hosting test"

    Let fact5 be factorial(5)
    Print "Factorial of 5 calculated"

    Let fib7 be fibonacci(7)
    Print "Fibonacci of 7 calculated"

    Let combined be fact5 + fib7
    Return combined
End Process
