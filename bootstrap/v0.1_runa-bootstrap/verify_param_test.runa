Process called "add_numbers" that takes first as Integer, second as Integer returns Integer:
    Let sum be first + second
    Return sum
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: 5 + 3 = 8, so this should return 8
    Let result be add_numbers(5, 3)
    Return result
End Process
