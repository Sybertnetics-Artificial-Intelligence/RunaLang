Process called "factorial" takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    If n is less than or equal to 1:
        Return 1
    Otherwise:
        Return n multiplied by factorial(n minus 1)
    End If
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let sum be 0
    Let i be 1
    While i is less than or equal to 20:
        Let result be factorial(i)
        Set sum to sum plus result
        Set i to i plus 1
    End While
    Return 0
End Process
