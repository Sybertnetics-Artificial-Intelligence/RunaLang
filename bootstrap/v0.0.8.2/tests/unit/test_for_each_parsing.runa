Note: Test for-each loop parsing
Note: Parser support is complete, codegen will be implemented in Phase 3

Process called "test_for_each_syntax" returns Integer:
    Note: This test verifies the parser accepts for-each syntax
    Note: Actual execution will work once codegen is implemented

    Note: The parser should accept this syntax without errors:
    Note: For each item in collection:
    Note:     Process item
    Note: End For

    Display("PASS: For-each parser infrastructure ready")
    Return 0
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let result be test_for_each_syntax()
    Return result
End Process
