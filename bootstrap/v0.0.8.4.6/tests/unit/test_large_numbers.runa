Note: Test large number arithmetic
Note: This tests operations on very large int64 values
Note: Expected: Should handle large numbers correctly

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test arithmetic with large positive numbers
    Let large1 be 9223372036854775000
    Let large2 be 100
    Let sum be large1 plus large2

    Note: Test arithmetic with large negative numbers
    Let neg_large be -9223372036854775000
    Let diff be neg_large minus large2

    Note: Test multiplication with moderately large numbers
    Let a be 1000000
    Let b be 1000000
    Let product be a multiplied by b

    Note: Product should be 1000000000000 (1 trillion)
    Let expected be 1000000000000
    If product is equal to expected:
        Return 0
    End If

    Return 1
End Process
