# Function pointer test with call

Process called "add" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a plus b
End Process

Process called "sub" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a minus b
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    # Test function pointer with $ prefix and call
    Let op be $add
    Let result be op(10, 5)
    Print result  # Should print 15

    # Change to different function
    Set op to $sub
    Set result to op(10, 5)
    Print result  # Should print 5

    Return 0
End Process
