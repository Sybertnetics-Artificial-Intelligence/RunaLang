Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    # Test list literal

    # Test list with comma separators
    Let numbers be a list containing 10, 20, 30, 40
    print_string("List with multiple elements created")

    # Test "a" as variable name (context-sensitive parsing)
    Let a be 42
    print_integer(a)

    # Test another list after using "a" as variable
    Let another_list be a list containing 100, 200
    print_string("Another list created")
