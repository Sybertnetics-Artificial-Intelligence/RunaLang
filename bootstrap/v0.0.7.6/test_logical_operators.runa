Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let x be 1
    Let y be 0

    If x is equal to 1 and y is equal to 0:
        print_string("and works in If condition")
    End If

    If x is equal to 1 or y is equal to 1:
        print_string("or works in If condition")
    End If

    If y is not equal to 1:
        print_string("is not equal works")
    End If

    Return 0
End Process
