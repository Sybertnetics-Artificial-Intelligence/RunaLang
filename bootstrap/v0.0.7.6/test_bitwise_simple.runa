Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Pointer returns Integer:
    Let a be 12
    Let b be 5
    Let result_and be a bit_and b
    Let result_or be a bit_or b
    Let result_xor be a bit_xor b
    Let result_shl be a bit_shift_left 2
    Let result_shr be a bit_shift_right 1
    Return result_and plus result_or plus result_xor plus result_shl plus result_shr
End Process
