# Function pointer test with main variable name

Process called "add" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a plus b
End Process

Process called "sub" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a minus b
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    # Test function pointer using "main" as variable name
    Let main be $add
    Let result be main(10, 5)
    Print result  # Should print 15

    Return 0
End Process
