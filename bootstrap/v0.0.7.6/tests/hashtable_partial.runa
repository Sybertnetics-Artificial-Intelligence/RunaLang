# Hash Table Implementation - Line-for-line transliteration from hashtable.c
# Preserves exact hash function (djb2), collision handling, and resize logic

# ==== Type Definitions ====
# WORKAROUND: Types commented out due to v0.0.7.3 bug with Type+Let combo
# Once v0.0.7.5 is self-hosted, uncomment these

# Type called "HashEntry":
#     key as Integer,       # Pointer to key
#     value as Integer,     # Pointer to value
#     next as Integer       # Pointer to next entry (for chaining)
# End Type

# Type called "HashTable":
#     buckets as Integer,       # Pointer to array of HashEntry pointers
#     bucket_count as Integer,  # Number of buckets
#     entry_count as Integer,   # Number of entries
#     hash_func as Integer,     # Function pointer for hash function
#     compare_func as Integer,  # Function pointer for comparison
#     free_key as Integer,      # Function pointer for key destructor
#     free_value as Integer     # Function pointer for value destructor
# End Type

# Type called "HashIterator":
#     table as Integer,         # Pointer to HashTable
#     bucket_index as Integer,  # Current bucket index
#     current_entry as Integer  # Pointer to current HashEntry
# End Type

# Type called "HashTableStats":
#     bucket_count as Integer,
#     entry_count as Integer,
#     empty_buckets as Integer,
#     max_chain_length as Integer,
#     average_chain_length as Integer,  # Using Integer for simplicity (multiplied by 100)
#     load_factor as Integer            # Using Integer for simplicity (multiplied by 100)
# End Type

# ==== Hash Table Creation and Destruction ====

Process called "hashtable_create" takes initial_buckets as Integer, hash_func as Integer, compare_func as Integer returns Integer:
    Return hashtable_create_with_destructors(initial_buckets, hash_func, compare_func, 0, 0)
End Process

Process called "hashtable_create_with_destructors" takes initial_buckets as Integer, hash_func as Integer, compare_func as Integer, free_key as Integer, free_value as Integer returns Integer:
    If initial_buckets is equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If
    If hash_func is equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If
    If compare_func is equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If

    Let table be allocate(56)  # sizeof(HashTable)
    If table is equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If

    Let buckets_size be initial_buckets multiplied by 8
    Let buckets be allocate(buckets_size)
    If buckets is equal to 0:
        deallocate(table)
        Return 0
    End If

    # Initialize buckets to NULL
    Let i be 0
    While i is less than initial_buckets:
        memory_set_pointer_at_index(buckets, i, 0)
        Set i to i plus 1
    End While

    memory_set_pointer(table, 0, buckets)  # buckets
    memory_set_int32(table, 8, initial_buckets)  # bucket_count
    memory_set_int32(table, 16, 0)  # entry_count
    memory_set_pointer(table, 24, hash_func)  # hash_func
    memory_set_pointer(table, 32, compare_func)  # compare_func
    memory_set_pointer(table, 40, free_key)  # free_key
    memory_set_pointer(table, 48, free_value)  # free_value

    Return table
End Process

Process called "hashtable_destroy" takes table as Integer returns Integer:
    If table is equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If

    # Clear all entries
    hashtable_clear(table)

    # Free the buckets array
    Let buckets be memory_get_pointer(table, 0)
    deallocate(buckets)

    # Free the table itself
    deallocate(table)

    Return 0
End Process

# ==== Hash Table Operations ====


Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Return 0
End Process
