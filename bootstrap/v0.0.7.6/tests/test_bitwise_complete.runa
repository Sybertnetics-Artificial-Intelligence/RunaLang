Note: Test all bitwise operations

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test bit_and
    Let a be 12
    Let b be 10
    Let result be a bit_and b
    print result
    Note: Expected: 8 (1100 AND 1010 = 1000)

    Note: Test bit_or
    Let c be 12
    Let d be 10
    Let result2 be c bit_or d
    print result2
    Note: Expected: 14 (1100 OR 1010 = 1110)

    Note: Test bit_xor
    Let e be 12
    Let f be 10
    Let result3 be e bit_xor f
    print result3
    Note: Expected: 6 (1100 XOR 1010 = 0110)

    Note: Test bit_shift_left
    Let g be 5
    Let result4 be g bit_shift_left by 2
    print result4
    Note: Expected: 20 (101 << 2 = 10100)

    Note: Test bit_shift_right
    Let h be 20
    Let result5 be h bit_shift_right by 2
    print result5
    Note: Expected: 5 (10100 >> 2 = 101)

    Note: Test combined operations
    Let x be 15
    Let y be 7
    Let combined be x bit_and y
    Set combined to combined bit_or 8
    print combined
    Note: Expected: 15 ((1111 AND 0111 = 0111) OR 1000 = 1111)

    Return 0
End Process
