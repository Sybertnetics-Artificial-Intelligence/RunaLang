Note: Test For loop - range variant with default step
Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: For i from 1 to 5 (step defaults to 1)
    For i from 1 to 5:
        Display i
    End For

    Note: For i from 0 to 10 by 2
    For i from 0 to 10 by 2:
        Display i
    End For

    Return 0
End Process
