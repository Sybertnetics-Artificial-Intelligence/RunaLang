Process called "test_negative_numbers" returns Integer:
    Note: Test negative number literals with minus sign
    Let a be -5
    Let b be -10
    Let c be -100

    Note: Test negative keyword
    Let d be negative 5
    Let e be negative 10
    Let f be negative 100

    Note: Test arithmetic with negatives
    Let result1 be a plus b  Note: -5 + -10 = -15
    Let result2 be d plus e  Note: -5 + -10 = -15

    Note: Test that both forms are equivalent
    Let diff be a minus d  Note: should be 0

    Return diff
End Process
