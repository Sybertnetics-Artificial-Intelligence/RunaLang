Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    print_string("Testing for-range loop:")

    Let sum be 0
    For i from 1 to 5:
        Increase sum by i
    End For

    print_string("Sum 1 to 5: ")
    print_integer(sum)

    Set sum to 0
    For i from 0 to 10 by 2:
        Increase sum by i
    End For

    print_string("Sum 0 to 10 by 2: ")
    print_integer(sum)

    Return 0
End Process
