# Test if/otherwise and while loops
Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let result be 0
    Let x be 5

    # Test if statement
    If x is equal to 5:
        Set result to 10
    Otherwise:
        Set result to 0
    End If

    # Test while loop
    Let counter be 0
    While counter is less than 5:
        Set result to result plus 1
        Set counter to counter plus 1
    End While

    Return result
End Process
