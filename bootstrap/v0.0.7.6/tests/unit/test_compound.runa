Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let x be 10
    print_string("Initial x: ")
    print_integer(x)

    Set x gets increased by 5
    print_string("After increased by 5: ")
    print_integer(x)

    Set x gets decreased by 3
    print_string("After decreased by 3: ")
    print_integer(x)

    Set x gets multiplied by 2
    print_string("After multiplied by 2: ")
    print_integer(x)

    Set x gets divided by 4
    print_string("After divided by 4: ")
    print_integer(x)

    Return 0
End Process
