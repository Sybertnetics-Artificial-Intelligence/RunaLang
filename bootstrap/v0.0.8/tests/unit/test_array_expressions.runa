Note: Test array with expression elements

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Create array with computed values
    Let computed be list containing 1 plus 1, 2 multiplied by 3, 10 minus 5, 20 divided by 4

    Note: Verify computed elements
    Let first be computed at index 0
    If first is not equal to 2:
        Return 1  Note: 1+1 should be 2
    End If

    Let second be computed at index 1
    If second is not equal to 6:
        Return 2  Note: 2*3 should be 6
    End If

    Let third be computed at index 2
    If third is not equal to 5:
        Return 3  Note: 10-5 should be 5
    End If

    Let fourth be computed at index 3
    If fourth is not equal to 5:
        Return 4  Note: 20/4 should be 5
    End If

    Return 0  Note: All tests passed
End Process
