Note: Test division by zero behavior
Note: This tests what happens when dividing by zero
Note: Expected: Should not crash (behavior may be undefined or return 0)

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test basic division by zero
    Let x be 10
    Let y be 0
    Let result be x divided by y

    Note: If we got here without crashing, test passes
    Note: Result value is undefined but we didn't crash
    Return 0
End Process
