# Test functions: Process called ... returns ...
Process called "add" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a plus b
    Return result
End Process

Process called "multiply" takes x as Integer, y as Integer returns Integer:
    Return x multiplied by y
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    # Test function call with two arguments
    Let sum be add(10, 5)
    Display sum

    # Test function call with expression
    Let product be multiply(4, 3)
    Display product

    # Test nested function calls
    Let nested be add(sum, product)
    Display nested

    Return 0
End Process
