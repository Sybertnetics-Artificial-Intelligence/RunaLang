Note: Test array access with computed indices

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Create array
    Let numbers be list containing 10, 20, 30, 40, 50

    Note: Access using computed index
    Let i be 2
    Let value be numbers at index i
    If value is not equal to 30:
        Return 1  Note: numbers[2] should be 30
    End If

    Note: Access using expression as index
    Let j be 1 plus 1
    Let value2 be numbers at index j
    If value2 is not equal to 30:
        Return 2  Note: numbers[1+1] should be 30
    End If

    Return 0  Note: All tests passed
End Process
