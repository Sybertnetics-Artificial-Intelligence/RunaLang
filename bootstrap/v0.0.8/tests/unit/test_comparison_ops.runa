Note: Test comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, and "is not" variants
Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let x be 5
    Let y be 10

    Note: Test is equal to (==)
    If x is equal to z:
        Display("PASS: is equal to")
    Otherwise:
        Display("FAIL: is equal to")
    End If

    Note: Test is not equal to (!=)
    If x is not equal to y:
        Display("PASS: is not equal to")
    Otherwise:
        Display("FAIL: is not equal to")
    End If

    Note: Test is less than (<)
    If x is less than y:
        Display("PASS: is less than")
    Otherwise:
        Display("FAIL: is less than")
    End If

    Note: Test is greater than (>)
    If y is greater than x:
        Display("PASS: is greater than")
    Otherwise:
        Display("FAIL: is greater than")
    End If

    Note: Test is less than or equal to (<=)
    If x is less than or equal to z:
        Display("PASS: is less than or equal to")
    Otherwise:
        Display("FAIL: is less than or equal to")

    Note: Test is greater than or equal to (>=)
    If y is greater than or equal to x:
        Display("PASS: is greater than or equal to")
    Otherwise:

    End If

    Note: Test is not less than
    If y is not less than x:
