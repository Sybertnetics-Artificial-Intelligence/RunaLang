# Test For loops: For var from start to end, For var from start to end by step
Process called "main" returns Integer:
    # Test basic For loop (from start to end)
    Let sum1 be 0
    For i from 1 to 5:
        Set sum1 to sum1 plus i
    End For
    Display sum1

    # Test For loop with step (by)
    Let sum2 be 0
    For j from 0 to 10 by 2:
        Set sum2 to sum2 plus j
    End For
    Display sum2

    # Test For loop with different range
    Let sum3 be 0
    For k from 5 to 10:
        Set sum3 to sum3 plus k
    End For
    Display sum3

    Return 0
End Process
