Note: Test array literal creation with canonical syntax
Note: "list containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Create array with 5 elements
    Let numbers be list containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

    Note: Access elements and verify values
    Let first be numbers at index 0
    If first is not equal to 1:
        Return 1  Note: First element should be 1
    End If

    Let second be numbers at index 1
    If second is not equal to 2:
        Return 2  Note: Second element should be 2
    End If

    Let third be numbers at index 2
    If third is not equal to 3:
        Return 3  Note: Third element should be 3
    End If

    Let fourth be numbers at index 3
    If fourth is not equal to 4:
        Return 4  Note: Fourth element should be 4
    End If

    Let fifth be numbers at index 4
    If fifth is not equal to 5:
        Return 5  Note: Fifth element should be 5
    End If

    Return 0  Note: All tests passed
End Process
