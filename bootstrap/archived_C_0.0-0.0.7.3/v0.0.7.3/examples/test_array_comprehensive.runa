Type IntArray is:
    array[20] of Integer
End Type

Process called "bubble_sort" takes arr as IntArray, size as Integer returns Integer:
    Let i be 0
    Let j be 0
    Let temp be 0

    While i is less than size:
        Set j to 0
        While j is less than size minus 1:
            If arr[j] is greater than arr[j plus 1]:
                Set temp to arr[j]
                Set arr[j] to arr[j plus 1]
                Set arr[j plus 1] to temp
            End If
            Set j to j plus 1
        End While
        Set i to i plus 1
    End While

    Return 0
End Process

Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let numbers be IntArray

    Set numbers[0] to 5
    Set numbers[1] to 2
    Set numbers[2] to 8
    Set numbers[3] to 1
    Set numbers[4] to 9

    Print numbers[0]
    Print numbers[1]
    Print numbers[2]
    Print numbers[3]
    Print numbers[4]

    Let result be bubble_sort(numbers, 5)

    Print numbers[0]
    Print numbers[1]
    Print numbers[2]
    Print numbers[3]
    Print numbers[4]

    Return 0
