Process called "add" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a plus b
    Return result
End Process

Process called "subtract" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a minus b
    Return result
End Process

Process called "multiply" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a multiplied by b
    Return result
End Process

Process called "divide" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a divided by b
    Return result
End Process

Process called "factorial" takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be 1
    Let i be 1
    While i is less than n:
        Set i to i plus 1
        Set result to multiply(result, i)
    End While
    Return result
End Process

Process called "complex_math" takes w as Integer, x as Integer, y as Integer, z as Integer, a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let sum1 be add(w, x)
    Let sum2 be add(y, z)
    Let product be multiply(sum1, sum2)
    Let diff be subtract(product, a)
    Let quotient be divide(diff, b)
    Return quotient
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
