Type called "Point":
    x as Integer,
    y as Integer
End Type

Type called "Rectangle":
    topleft as Point,
    bottomright as Point
End Type

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let rect be Rectangle
    Set rect.topleft.x to 10
    Set rect.topleft.y to 20
    Set rect.bottomright.x to 30
    Set rect.bottomright.y to 40
    Let width be rect.bottomright.x minus rect.topleft.x
    Let height be rect.bottomright.y minus rect.topleft.y
    Return width plus height
End Process
