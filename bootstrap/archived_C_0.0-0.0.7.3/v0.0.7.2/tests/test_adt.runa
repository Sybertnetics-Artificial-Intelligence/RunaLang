    | Circle with radius as Integer
    | Rectangle with width as Integer and height as Integer

Process called "test_shapes" returns Integer:
    Let shape1 be Circle with radius as 5

    Match shape1:
        When Circle with radius as r:
            Print r
        End When
        When Rectangle with width as w and height as h:
            Print w
            Print h
        End When
    End Match

    Let shape2 be Rectangle with width as 10 and height as 20

    Match shape2:
        When Circle with radius as r:
            Print r
        End When
        When Rectangle with width as w and height as h:
            Print w
            Print h
        End When
    End Match

    Return 0
