Note: Basic struct test using natural language syntax
Type called "Point":
    x as Integer
    y as Integer
End Type

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Create a Point using struct construction
    Let p be a Point with x 10 and y 20

    Note: Read and display fields
    Let x_val be the x of p
    Let y_val be the y of p

    Display x_val
    Display y_val

    deallocate(p)

    Return 0
End Process
