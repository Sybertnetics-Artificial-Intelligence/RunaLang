Process called "factorial" that takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    If n is less than 2:
        Return 1
    Otherwise:
        Return n plus factorial(n minus 1)
    End If
End Process

Process called "countdown" that takes start as Integer returns Integer:
    Let count be start
    While count is greater than 0:
        Print count
        Set count to count minus 1
    End While
    Return 0
End Process

Let result be factorial(5)
Print result

Let countdown_result be countdown(3)
Print countdown_result

Let my_list be a list containing 1, 2, and 3
Print my_list
