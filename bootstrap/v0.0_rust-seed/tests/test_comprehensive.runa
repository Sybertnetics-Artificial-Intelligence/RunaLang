Process called "calculate" that takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let sum be a plus b
    Let diff be a minus b
    Let result be sum plus diff
    Return result
End Process

Let x be 10
Let y be 5

Let result be calculate(x, y)
Print result

If result is greater than 20:
    Print 25
Otherwise:
    Print 0
End If
