Process called "tokenize_input" that takes source as String returns String:
    Note: Full tokenization implementation that scans source and generates tokens
    Let tokens be ""
    Let position be 0
    Let line be 1
    Let column be 1
    Let source_length be length_of(source)
    While position is less than source_length:
        Let current_char be char_at(source, position)
        Return tokens
    End While
    Return tokens
End Process
