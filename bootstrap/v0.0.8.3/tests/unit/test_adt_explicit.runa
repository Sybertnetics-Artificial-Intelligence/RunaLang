Note: Test Phase 5: Explicit variant syntax "TypeName as VariantName"

Type Option is:
    | None
    | Some with value as Integer
End Type

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test explicit syntax for fieldless variant
    Let x be Option as None
    Display "Created None using explicit syntax"

    Note: Test that implicit syntax still works
    Let y be None
    Display "Created None using implicit syntax"

    Return 0
End Process
