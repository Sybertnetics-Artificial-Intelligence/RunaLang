Type called "ThreeFields":
    first as Integer,
    second as Integer,
    third as Integer
End Type

Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let obj be ThreeFields
    Set obj.first to 10
    Set obj.second to 20
    Set obj.third to 30

    Let sum be obj.first plus obj.second
    Let total be sum plus obj.third
    Return total
End Process
