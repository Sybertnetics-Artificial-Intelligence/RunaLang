Type called "ThreeFields":
    first as Integer,
    second as Integer,
    third as Integer
End Type

Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let obj be ThreeFields
    Set obj.first to 100
    Set obj.second to 200
    Set obj.third to 300

    Print 100
    Print 200
    Print 300

    Print obj.first
    Print obj.second
    Print obj.third

    Let sum be obj.first plus obj.second
    Print sum

    Let total be sum plus obj.third
    Print total

    Return total
End Process
