Type called "Point":
    x as Integer
    y as Integer
End Type

Type called "Container":
    point as Point
    value as Integer
End Type

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let c be Container
    Set c.point.x to 42
    Set c.point.y to 24
    Set c.value to 100
    Return c.point.x
End Process
