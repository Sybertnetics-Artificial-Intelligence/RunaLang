Note: Test deep recursion behavior
Note: This tests stack depth limits with recursive function calls
Note: Expected: Should handle reasonable recursion depth without crashing

Process called "countdown" takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Simple recursive countdown
    If n is less than or equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If

    Note: Recurse with n-1
    Let result be countdown(n minus 1)
    Return result
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test with 1000 levels of recursion
    Note: This should not overflow the stack
    Let result be countdown(1000)

    Note: Result should be 0
    If result is equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If

    Return 1
End Process
