Note: Test edge cases and incomplete syntax for struct field specifications

Type called "Point":
    x as Integer
    y as Integer
End Type

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: This test validates parser error handling for incomplete/invalid syntax
    Note: These should fail gracefully during parsing

    Note: Valid case for comparison
    Let p be a value of type Point with x as 10 and y as 20
    Display the x of p
    deallocate(p)

    Return 0
End Process
