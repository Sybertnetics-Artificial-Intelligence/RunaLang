Note: Comprehensive test for struct construction syntax and edge cases

Type called "Point":
    x as Integer
    y as Integer
End Type

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test 1: Complete valid construction
    Let p1 be a value of type Point with x as 10 and y as 20
    Let x1 be the x of p1
    Let y1 be the y of p1
    Display x1
    Display y1
    deallocate(p1)

    Note: Test 2: Single field construction
    Let p2 be a value of type Point with x as 5 and y as 0
    Let x2 be the x of p2
    Display x2
    deallocate(p2)

    Note: Test 3: Variable named "value" is allowed
    Let value be 42
    Display value

    Return 0
End Process
