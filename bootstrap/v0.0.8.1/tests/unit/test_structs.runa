Note: Comprehensive struct test: types, construction, field access, and edge cases

Type called "Point":
    x as Integer
    y as Integer
End Type

Type called "Rectangle":
    width as Integer
    height as Integer
End Type

Type called "Single":
    value as Integer
End Type

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test 1: Basic two-field struct
    Let p be a value of type Point with x as 10 and y as 20
    Let x_val be the x of p
    Let y_val be the y of p
    Display x_val
    Display y_val

    Note: Test 2: Field assignment
    Set the x of p to 15
    Set the y of p to 25
    Let x_val2 be the x of p
    Let y_val2 be the y of p
    Display x_val2
    Display y_val2
    deallocate(p)

    Note: Test 3: Rectangle with different field names
    Let rect be a value of type Rectangle with width as 100 and height as 50
    Let w be the width of rect
    Let h be the height of rect
    Display w
    Display h
    Let area be w multiplied by h
    Display area
    deallocate(rect)

    Note: Test 4: Single-field struct
    Let s be a value of type Single with value as 99
    Let v be the value of s
    Display v
    deallocate(s)

    Note: Test 5: Two structs of same type
    Let p1 be a value of type Point with x as 1 and y as 2
    Let p2 be a value of type Point with x as 3 and y as 4
    Display the x of p1
    Display the y of p1
    Display the x of p2
    Display the y of p2
    deallocate(p1)
    deallocate(p2)

    Return 0
End Process
