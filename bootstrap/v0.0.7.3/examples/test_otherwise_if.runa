Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Print "Testing Otherwise If (elif chains)\n"

    # Test simple elif chain
    Let x be 5
    If x is equal to 1:
        Print "x is 1\n"
    Otherwise If x is equal to 2:

    Otherwise If x is equal to 5:
        Print "x is 5 - CORRECT!\n"
    Otherwise:
        Print "x is something else\n"
