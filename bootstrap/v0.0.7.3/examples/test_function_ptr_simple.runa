# Simple function pointer test - declare and call

Process called "add" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a plus b
End Process

Process called "sub" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a minus b
End Process

Type BinaryOp is Pointer to Process takes x as Integer and y as Integer returns Integer

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    # Test direct function pointer assignment and call
    Let op be add
    Let result be op(10, 5)
    Print result  # Should print 15

    # Change function pointer to different function
    Set op to sub
    Set result to op(10, 5)
    Print result  # Should print 5

    Return 0
End Process
