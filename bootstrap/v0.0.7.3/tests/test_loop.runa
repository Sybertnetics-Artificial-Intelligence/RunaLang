Process called "factorial" takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be 1
    Let i be 1
    While i is less than n plus 1:
        Set result to result multiplied by i
        Set i to i plus 1
    End While
    Return result
End Process

Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be factorial(5)
    Return result
End Process
