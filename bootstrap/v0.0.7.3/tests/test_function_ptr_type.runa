# Function pointer with type definition test

Process called "multiply" takes x as Integer, y as Integer returns Integer:
    Return x multiplied by y
End Process

Process called "divide" takes x as Integer, y as Integer returns Integer:
    Return x divided by y
End Process

# Define a function pointer type for arithmetic operations
Type ArithmeticOp is Pointer to Process takes a as Integer and b as Integer returns Integer

Process called "calculate" takes op as ArithmeticOp, x as Integer, y as Integer returns Integer:
    Return op(x, y)
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    # Use function pointers through typed parameters
    Let mult_result be calculate(multiply, 6, 7)
    Print mult_result  # Should print 42

    Let div_result be calculate(divide, 20, 4)
    Print div_result   # Should print 5

    Return 0
End Process
