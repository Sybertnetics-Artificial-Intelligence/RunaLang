Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Print "Simple Bitwise Test\n"

    # Test basic operations
    Print "12 bit_and 10: "
    Print integer_to_string(12 bit_and 10)
    Print "\n"

    Print "12 bit_or 10: "
    Print integer_to_string(12 bit_or 10)
    Print "\n"

    Print "12 bit_xor 10: "
    Print integer_to_string(12 bit_xor 10)
    Print "\n"

    Print "5 bit_shift_left by 2: "
    Print integer_to_string(5 bit_shift_left by 2)
    Print "\n"

    Print "20 bit_shift_right by 2: "
    Print integer_to_string(20 bit_shift_right by 2)
    Print "\n"
