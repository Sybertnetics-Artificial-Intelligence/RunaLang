Let count1 be 10
Let count2 be 20
Let count3 be 30

Process called "test_globals" returns Integer:
    Print count1
    Print count2
    Print count3

    Set count1 to count1 plus 5
    Set count2 to count2 multiplied by 2
    Set count3 to count1 plus count2

    Print count1
    Print count2
    Print count3

    Return count3
End Process

Process called "modify_globals" returns Integer:
    Set count1 to 100
    Set count2 to 200
    Set count3 to 300
    Return 0
End Process

Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be test_globals()
    Print result

    Let dummy be modify_globals()

    Print count1
    Print count2
    Print count3

    Return 0
End Process
