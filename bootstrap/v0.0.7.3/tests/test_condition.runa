Process called "max" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    If a is less than b:
        Return b
    Otherwise:
        Return a
    End If
End Process

Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be max(15, 25)
    Return result
End Process
