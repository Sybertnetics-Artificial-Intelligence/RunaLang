Let global_counter be 100

Process called "increment" returns Integer:
    Set global_counter to global_counter plus 1
    Return global_counter
End Process

Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Print global_counter
    Let result be increment()
    Print result
    Return 0
End Process
