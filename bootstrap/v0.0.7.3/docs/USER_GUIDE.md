# Runa v0.0.7.3 Complete User Guide

> **Welcome to Runa v0.0.7.3!** This is your complete guide to using the Runa programming language compiler until the full language is ready for production.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Linux/Unix environment (tested on Ubuntu/WSL2)
- GCC compiler
- Make utility

### Your First Runa Program

1. **Create a simple program** (`hello.runa`):
```runa
Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Return 42
End Process
```

2. **Compile it**:
```bash
./runac hello.runa hello.s
```

3. **Link and build executable**:
```bash
gcc -o hello hello.s runtime_*.o -no-pie -lm
```

4. **Run it**:
```bash
./hello
echo "Exit code: $?"  # Should show: Exit code: 42
```

**üéâ Congratulations! You've just compiled and run your first Runa program!**

## üìö Complete Language Reference

### Process (Function) Declaration

**Basic Syntax:**
```runa
Process called "function_name" takes param1 as Type, param2 as Type returns ReturnType:
    # Function body
    Return value
End Process
```

**Examples:**

**Simple function with no parameters:**
```runa
Process called "get_answer" returns Integer:
    Return 42
End Process
```

**Function with parameters:**
```runa
Process called "add" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a plus b
End Process
```

**Main function (program entry point):**
```runa
Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    # Your program logic here
    Return 0
End Process
```

### Variables and Assignment

**Declaring variables:**
```runa
Let variable_name be value
Let x be 10
Let name be "Hello World"
```

**Setting variables:**
```runa
Set variable_name to new_value
Set x to 20
Set name to "New Value"
```

### Data Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `Integer` | 64-bit signed integer | `42`, `-100`, `0` |
| `String` | Text data | `"Hello"`, `"World"` |
| Custom Types | User-defined structs | See Type Definitions below |

### Arithmetic Operations

| Operation | Syntax | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Addition | `a plus b` | `5 plus 3` ‚Üí `8` |
| Subtraction | `a minus b` | `10 minus 4` ‚Üí `6` |
| Multiplication | `a multiplied by b` | `6 multiplied by 7` ‚Üí `42` |
| Division | `a divided by b` | `20 divided by 4` ‚Üí `5` |
| Modulo | `a modulo b` | `10 modulo 3` ‚Üí `1` |

**Example:**
```runa
Process called "calculate" returns Integer:
    Let x be 10
    Let y be 20
    Let sum be x plus y
    Let product be x multiplied by y
    Let result be sum plus product
    Return result
End Process
```

### Comparison Operations

| Operation | Syntax | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Less than | `a is less than b` | `5 is less than 10` |
| Greater than | `a is greater than b` | `15 is greater than 10` |
| Equal to | `a equals b` | `5 equals 5` |
| Not equal | `a is not equal to b` | `5 is not equal to 10` |

### Control Flow

**If Statements:**
```runa
If condition:
    # statements
Otherwise:
    # alternative statements
End If
```

**Example:**
```runa
Process called "max" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    If a is greater than b:
        Return a
    Otherwise:
        Return b
    End If
End Process
```

**Nested If Statements:**
```runa
Process called "classify" takes x as Integer returns Integer:
    If x is greater than 0:
        If x is less than 10:
            Return 1  # Small positive
        Otherwise:
            Return 2  # Large positive
        End If
    Otherwise:
        Return 0  # Zero or negative
    End If
End Process
```

**While Loops:**
```runa
While condition:
    # statements
    # (make sure to modify condition variables!)
End While
```

**Example (Factorial):**
```runa
Process called "factorial" takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be 1
    Let i be 1
    While i is less than n plus 1:
        Set result to result multiplied by i
        Set i to i plus 1
    End While
    Return result
End Process
```

### Type Definitions (Structs)

**Basic Syntax:**
```runa
Type called "TypeName":
    field1 as Type1,
    field2 as Type2,
    field3 as Type3
End Type
```

**Example:**
```runa
Type called "Point":
    x as Integer,
    y as Integer
End Type

Type called "Rectangle":
    top_left as Point,
    width as Integer,
    height as Integer
End Type
```

**Using Custom Types:**
```runa
Process called "calculate_area" returns Integer:
    Let rect be Rectangle
    Let point be Point

    # Set up point
    Set point.x to 10
    Set point.y to 20

    # Set up rectangle
    Set rect.top_left to point
    Set rect.width to 30
    Set rect.height to 40

    # Calculate area
    Let area be rect.width multiplied by rect.height
    Return area
End Process
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Complete Build Process

### Method 1: Manual Compilation (Recommended for Learning)

```bash
# Step 1: Compile Runa source to assembly
./runac your_program.runa your_program.s

# Step 2: Link with runtime and build executable
gcc -o your_program your_program.s runtime_*.o -no-pie -lm

# Step 3: Run your program
./your_program
```

### Method 2: One-Line Build

```bash
./runac program.runa program.s && gcc -o program program.s runtime_*.o -no-pie -lm && ./program
```

### Method 3: Build Script

Create `build_runa.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <program.runa> [output_name]"
    exit 1
fi

RUNA_FILE="$1"
OUTPUT="${2:-${RUNA_FILE%.runa}}"
ASM_FILE="${OUTPUT}.s"

echo "Compiling $RUNA_FILE..."
./runac "$RUNA_FILE" "$ASM_FILE" || exit 1

echo "Linking..."
gcc -o "$OUTPUT" "$ASM_FILE" runtime_*.o -no-pie -lm || exit 1

echo "‚úÖ Build successful! Run with: ./$OUTPUT"
```

Make it executable and use:
```bash
chmod +x build_runa.sh
./build_runa.sh my_program.runa
```

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "undefined reference to sin/cos/etc"

**Problem:** Mathematical functions not linking properly.

**Solution:** Always include `-lm` flag:
```bash
gcc -o program program.s runtime_*.o -no-pie -lm
```

### Issue: "Segmentation fault"

**Problem:** Usually memory access issues or uninitialized variables.

**Debug steps:**
1. Check that all variables are properly initialized
2. Verify struct field assignments before use
3. Use smaller, simpler test cases to isolate the issue

### Issue: "Error" output with working exit code

**Problem:** This is normal! Runa programs often print "Error" but return the correct exit code.

**Verification:** Always check exit code:
```bash
./program; echo "Exit code: $?"
```

### Issue: Compilation errors

**Common fixes:**
- Ensure proper `End Process` and `End Type` statements
- Check spelling of keywords (`Process`, `Return`, `Integer`, etc.)
- Verify proper indentation and syntax
- Make sure all variables are declared with `Let` before use

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization

```runa
# Define types first
Type called "MyType":
    field1 as Integer,
    field2 as String
End Type

# Then helper functions
Process called "helper_function" takes param as Integer returns Integer:
    Return param plus 1
End Process

# Main function last
Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    # Your main logic
    Return 0
End Process
```

### 2. Error Handling

```runa
Process called "safe_divide" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    If b equals 0:
        Return -1  # Error indicator
    Otherwise:
        Return a divided by b
    End If
End Process
```

### 3. Meaningful Variable Names

```runa
# Good:
Let student_count be 25
Let average_score be total_points divided by student_count

# Avoid:
Let x be 25
Let y be total divided by x
```

### 4. Comments for Complex Logic

```runa
Process called "complex_calculation" takes input as Integer returns Integer:
    # Calculate compound interest over 5 years
    Let principal be input
    Let rate be 5  # 5% annual interest
    Let years be 5

    Let i be 0
    While i is less than years:
        # A = P(1 + r/100)
        Let new_amount be principal plus (principal multiplied by rate divided by 100)
        Set principal to new_amount
        Set i to i plus 1
    End While

    Return principal
End Process
```
