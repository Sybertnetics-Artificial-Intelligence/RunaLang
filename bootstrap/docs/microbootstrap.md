# ðŸ›  Micro Bootstrap Plan for Runa

## ðŸŒ± Stage 0: Minimal C Seed Compiler (v0.0)

**Goal**: Smallest C program that can parse and compile a trivial Runa program into x86-64 assembly.

* Language subset: only `Process main â€¦ Return <int> End Process`
* Backend: emits raw `.s` file with `_start` calling Linux `exit()`
* Dependencies: `as`, `ld`
* Runtime: none (just syscalls)
* Lines of code: \~300â€“500 in C

ðŸ‘‰ **Outcome**: Can compile:

```runa
Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Return 0
End Process
```

into a working ELF executable.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 0.0.1: Variables + Arithmetic

**Goal**: Add integer literals, variables, and arithmetic.

* Parse `Let x be 42`
* Parse binary ops: `plus`, `minus`
* Generate assembly with registers and stack slots
* Implement return expressions (not just constants)

ðŸ‘‰ **Outcome**:

```runa
Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let x be 40
    Let y be 2
    Return x plus y
End Process
```

â†’ executable returns 42.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 0.0.2: Conditionals + Loops

**Goal**: Add `If`, `Otherwise`, `While`.

* Emit labels + jumps
* Boolean operators: `is equal to`, `is less than`, etc.
* Stack-based variable model

ðŸ‘‰ **Outcome**:

```runa
Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let x be 0
    While x is less than 10:
        Set x to x plus 1
    End While
    Return x
End Process
```

â†’ returns 10.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 0.0.3: Functions + Calls

**Goal**: Multi-function programs.

* Parse function definitions
* Handle parameters + return values
* System V ABI: pass args in `%rdi`, `%rsi`, etc.
* Support recursive calls

ðŸ‘‰ **Outcome**:

```runa
Process called "factorial" that takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    If n is equal to 0:
        Return 1
    Otherwise:
        Return n multiplied by factorial(n minus 1)
    End If
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Return factorial(5)
End Process
```

â†’ returns 120.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 0.0.4: Strings + Print

**Goal**: Basic runtime functions.

* Add string literals â†’ put in `.rodata`
* Add `print` syscall wrapper
* Minimal runtime in C/asm for I/O

ðŸ‘‰ **Outcome**:

```runa
Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Print "Hello, Runa!"
    Return 0
End Process
```

â†’ prints to console.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 0.0.5: Lists (Opaque Pointers)

**Goal**: Runtime-managed lists.

* Add `list_create`, `list_append`, `list_get`
* Implement in C runtime for now
* Compiler only needs to recognize built-in calls

ðŸ‘‰ **Outcome**:

```runa
Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let nums be list_create()
    list_append(nums, 1)
    list_append(nums, 2)
    Return list_get(nums, 1)
End Process
```

â†’ returns 2.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 0.0.6: Types + Structs

**Goal**: User-defined types.

* Parse `Type called â€¦`
* Lay out structs in memory
* Support field access via offsets

ðŸ‘‰ **Outcome**:

```runa
Type called "Point":
    x as Integer
    y as Integer
End Type

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let p be a value of type Point with
        x as 10,
        y as 32
    Return p.x plus p.y
End Process
```

â†’ returns 42.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 0.0.7: Self-Hosting Prep

**Goal**: Enough features to write the compiler in Runa itself.

* File I/O (`read_file`, `write_file`)
* Better string ops
* Dictionaries or Maps
* Basic module system (`Import "..." as ...`)

ðŸ‘‰ **Outcome**: Runa can write its **own lexer and parser**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 0.0.7.5: First Self-Hosted Compiler

**Goal**: Runa compiler written in Runa, compiled by v0.0â€“0.7 seed.

* Compiler pipeline: Lexer â†’ Parser â†’ Codegen
* Still emits `.s` â†’ `as/ld`
* C seed archived

ðŸ‘‰ **Outcome**: Runa is **self-hosting**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 0.0.8: Inline Assembly

**Goal**: Cut out assembler dependency.

* Support:

```runa
Inline Assembly:
    mov $60, %rax
    xor %rdi, %rdi
    syscall
End Assembly
```

* Embed raw assembly into output
* Prepare for own object writer

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stage 0.0.9: Native Object Writer + Linker

**Goal**: No `as`/`ld`.

* Generate ELF directly
* Write custom linker
* Runa compiler produces standalone executables

ðŸ‘‰ Now youâ€™re fully independent of external toolchains.

# ðŸš€ Handoff to Runa: v0.1 (First Self-Host)

At this stage, the C compiler (`v0.0.7`) can compile enough Runa to write a compiler in Runa itself.

**Runa features guaranteed by C seed:**

* Integers, booleans, strings.
* Variables, assignment, arithmetic.
* Conditionals (`If/Otherwise`), loops (`While`).
* Functions + recursion.
* Lists + structs.
* File I/O.
* Module system.

**Runa compiler in Runa (`v0.1`) will implement:**

* Lexer in Runa.
* Parser in Runa.
* Type checker in Runa.
* Codegen (x86-64) in Runa.
* Uses runtime built in C (for now).

Example:

```runa
Import "lexer" as Lexer
Import "parser" as Parser
Import "codegen" as CodeGen

Process called "main" that takes args as List[String] returns Integer:
    Let src be read_file("input.runa")
    Let tokens be Lexer.tokenize(src)
    Let ast be Parser.parse(tokens)
    Let asm be CodeGen.generate(ast)
    write_file("output.s", asm)
    Return 0
End Process
```

---

âœ… So the **minimum Runa subset for v0.1** is exactly whatâ€™s in `v0.0.7`.
From there, future versions (v0.2+) add *For Each*, *Match*, IR, optimizations, etc.
