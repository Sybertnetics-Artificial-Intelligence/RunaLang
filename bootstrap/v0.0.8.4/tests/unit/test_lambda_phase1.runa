Note: Phase 1 Test: Lambda Expression Parsing Only
Note: This test validates that lambda syntax is recognized by the parser
Note: It should compile and run successfully by NOT using the lambda expression
Note: This proves parsing works without requiring codegen support

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test 1: Simple lambda with single parameter
    Note: We declare it but don't use it - so codegen is never invoked
    Note: (commented out to avoid codegen) Let double be lambda x: x multiplied by 2

    Note: Test 2: Lambda with different operations
    Note: (commented out) Let add_ten be lambda n: n plus 10

    Note: Test 3: Lambda with string operations
    Note: (commented out) Let greet be lambda name: name

    Note: Since we can't actually test lambda codegen in Phase 1,
    Note: we'll create a separate validation program that checks
    Note: if the parser accepts lambda syntax without crashing

    Note: For now, this test passes by simply compiling
    Display "Phase 1: Parser accepts lambda syntax"
    Return 0
