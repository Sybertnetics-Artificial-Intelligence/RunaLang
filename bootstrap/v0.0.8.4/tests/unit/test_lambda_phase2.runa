Note: Phase 2 Test: Lambda Codegen - Simple (No Closures)
Note: Tests lambda expression compilation without invocation
Note: Success criteria: Compiles, assembles, links, runs, returns 0

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test 1: Lambda with parameter reference
    Let double be lambda x: x multiplied by 2

    Note: Test 2: Lambda with constant body
    Let constant be lambda y: 42

    Note: Test 3: Lambda with arithmetic expression
    Let add_ten be lambda n: n plus 10

    Note: Test 4: Lambda with comparison
    Let is_positive be lambda val: val is greater than 0

    Note: Don't invoke yet - just verify closure allocation works
    Return 0
End Process
