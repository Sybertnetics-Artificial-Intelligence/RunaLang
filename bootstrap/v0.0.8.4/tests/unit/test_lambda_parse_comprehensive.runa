Note: Phase 1 Comprehensive Test: Lambda Expression Parsing
Note: Tests multiple lambda syntax variations
Note: Should parse successfully and fail at codegen with expected error

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test 1: Simple arithmetic lambda
    Let double be lambda x: x multiplied by 2

    Note: Test 2: Addition lambda
    Let add_five be lambda n: n plus 5

    Note: Test 3: Subtraction lambda
    Let subtract_one be lambda val: val minus 1

    Note: Test 4: Division lambda
    Let half be lambda num: num divided by 2

    Note: Test 5: Comparison in lambda
    Let is_positive be lambda x: x is greater than 0

    Note: Test 6: Lambda with string operations
    Let get_length be lambda s: s

    Note: Test 7: Complex expression in lambda body
    Let formula be lambda a: a multiplied by 2 plus 10

    Note: Test 8: Lambda assigned to different variable
    Let my_func be lambda param: param

    Return 0
End Process
