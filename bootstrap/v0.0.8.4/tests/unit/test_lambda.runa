Note: Lambda Expression Test Suite
Note: Comprehensive test covering all lambda phases
Note: This file will be expanded as new phases are implemented

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Phase 1-2: Lambda creation (parsing and codegen)
    Let double be lambda x: x multiplied by 2
    Let add_ten be lambda n: n plus 10
    Let constant be lambda y: 42

    Note: Phase 3: Lambda invocation with single parameter
    Let result1 be double with 4
    If result1 is not equal to 8:
        Return 1
    End If

    Let result2 be add_ten with 5
    If result2 is not equal to 15:
        Return 2
    End If

    Let result3 be constant with 0
    If result3 is not equal to 42:
        Return 3
    End If

    Note: All tests passed
    Return 0
End Process
