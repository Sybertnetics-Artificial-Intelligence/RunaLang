Note:
This file implements FPGA syscalls for field-programmable gate array execution and memory management in the Runa runtime system interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process FPGA kernel launch syscalls and field-programmable gate array execution management with hardware synthesis and pipeline configuration
- Handle FPGA memory management syscalls and field-programmable gate array memory allocation with block RAM and distributed RAM
- Manage FPGA device management syscalls and field-programmable gate array device enumeration with FPGA context management
- Process FPGA synchronization syscalls and field-programmable gate array barrier operations with hardware synthesis synchronization
- Handle FPGA stream management syscalls and field-programmable gate array execution streams with hardware synthesis execution
- Process FPGA event management syscalls and field-programmable gate array timing operations with hardware synthesis performance monitoring
- Handle FPGA debugging syscalls and field-programmable gate array error handling with FPGA-specific error reporting
- Process FPGA profiling syscalls and field-programmable gate array performance monitoring with FPGA-specific profiling

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- fpga_syscalls enables comprehensive FPGA field-programmable gate array system interface and kernel execution management
