- Proper rump handling ensures correct userspace kernel operations and user experience
- rump_syscalls support enables Runa compilation for NetBSD rump workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Rump system calls and userspace kernel execution
- Rump kernel operations and rump management
- Rump coordination and rump synchronization
- Rump error handling and rump feedback
