Note:
This file implements OpenCL syscalls for cross-platform GPU kernel execution and memory management in the Runa runtime system interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process OpenCL kernel launch syscalls and cross-platform GPU execution management with work group and work item configuration
- Handle OpenCL memory management syscalls and cross-platform GPU memory allocation with global, local, and private memory
- Manage OpenCL device management syscalls and cross-platform GPU device enumeration with OpenCL context management
- Process OpenCL synchronization syscalls and cross-platform GPU barrier operations with work group synchronization
- Handle OpenCL command queue management syscalls and cross-platform GPU execution queues with asynchronous execution
- Process OpenCL event management syscalls and cross-platform GPU timing operations with performance monitoring
- Handle OpenCL debugging syscalls and cross-platform GPU error handling with OpenCL-specific error reporting
- Process OpenCL profiling syscalls and cross-platform GPU performance monitoring with OpenCL-specific profiling

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- opencl_syscalls enables comprehensive OpenCL cross-platform GPU system interface and kernel execution management
- Proper OpenCL syscalls ensure correct cross-platform GPU kernel execution and OpenCL memory management
- opencl_syscalls support enables Runa runtime for advanced OpenCL cross-platform GPU programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- OpenCL kernel launch syscalls and cross-platform GPU execution management with work group and work item configuration
- OpenCL memory management syscalls and cross-platform GPU memory allocation with global, local, and private memory
- OpenCL device management syscalls and cross-platform GPU device enumeration with OpenCL context management
- OpenCL synchronization syscalls and cross-platform GPU barrier operations with work group synchronization
- OpenCL command queue management syscalls and cross-platform GPU execution queues with asynchronous execution
- OpenCL event management syscalls and cross-platform GPU timing operations with performance monitoring
- OpenCL debugging syscalls and cross-platform GPU error handling with OpenCL-specific error reporting
- OpenCL profiling syscalls and cross-platform GPU performance monitoring with OpenCL-specific profiling
