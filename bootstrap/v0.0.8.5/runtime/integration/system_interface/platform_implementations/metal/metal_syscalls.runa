Note:
This file implements Metal syscalls for Apple GPU kernel execution and memory management in the Runa runtime system interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Metal kernel launch syscalls and Apple GPU execution management with thread group and thread configuration
- Handle Metal memory management syscalls and Apple GPU memory allocation with device memory and thread group memory
- Manage Metal device management syscalls and Apple GPU device enumeration with Metal context management
- Process Metal synchronization syscalls and Apple GPU barrier operations with thread group synchronization
- Handle Metal command buffer management syscalls and Apple GPU execution buffers with asynchronous execution
- Process Metal event management syscalls and Apple GPU timing operations with performance monitoring
- Handle Metal debugging syscalls and Apple GPU error handling with Metal-specific error reporting
- Process Metal profiling syscalls and Apple GPU performance monitoring with Metal-specific profiling

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- metal_syscalls enables comprehensive Metal Apple GPU system interface and kernel execution management
- Proper Metal syscalls ensure correct Apple GPU kernel execution and Metal memory management
- metal_syscalls support enables Runa runtime for advanced Metal Apple GPU programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Metal kernel launch syscalls and Apple GPU execution management with thread group and thread configuration
- Metal memory management syscalls and Apple GPU memory allocation with device memory and thread group memory
- Metal device management syscalls and Apple GPU device enumeration with Metal context management
- Metal synchronization syscalls and Apple GPU barrier operations with thread group synchronization
- Metal command buffer management syscalls and Apple GPU execution buffers with asynchronous execution
- Metal event management syscalls and Apple GPU timing operations with performance monitoring
- Metal debugging syscalls and Apple GPU error handling with Metal-specific error reporting
- Metal profiling syscalls and Apple GPU performance monitoring with Metal-specific profiling
