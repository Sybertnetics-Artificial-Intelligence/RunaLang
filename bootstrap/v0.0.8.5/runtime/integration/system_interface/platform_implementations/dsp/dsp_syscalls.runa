Note:
This file implements DSP syscalls for digital signal processing execution and memory management in the Runa runtime system interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process DSP kernel launch syscalls and digital signal processing execution management with pipeline and real-time processing configuration
- Handle DSP memory management syscalls and digital signal processing memory allocation with signal buffer and coefficient memory
- Manage DSP device management syscalls and digital signal processing device enumeration with DSP context management
- Process DSP synchronization syscalls and digital signal processing barrier operations with pipeline synchronization
- Handle DSP stream management syscalls and digital signal processing execution streams with real-time processing
- Process DSP event management syscalls and digital signal processing timing operations with real-time performance monitoring
- Handle DSP debugging syscalls and digital signal processing error handling with DSP-specific error reporting
- Process DSP profiling syscalls and digital signal processing performance monitoring with DSP-specific profiling

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- dsp_syscalls enables comprehensive DSP digital signal processing system interface and kernel execution management
- Proper DSP syscalls ensure correct digital signal processing kernel execution and DSP memory management
- dsp_syscalls support enables Runa runtime for advanced DSP digital signal processing programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- DSP kernel launch syscalls and digital signal processing execution management with pipeline and real-time processing configuration
- DSP memory management syscalls and digital signal processing memory allocation with signal buffer and coefficient memory
- DSP device management syscalls and digital signal processing device enumeration with DSP context management
- DSP synchronization syscalls and digital signal processing barrier operations with pipeline synchronization
- DSP stream management syscalls and digital signal processing execution streams with real-time processing
- DSP event management syscalls and digital signal processing timing operations with real-time performance monitoring
- DSP debugging syscalls and digital signal processing error handling with DSP-specific error reporting
- DSP profiling syscalls and digital signal processing performance monitoring with DSP-specific profiling
