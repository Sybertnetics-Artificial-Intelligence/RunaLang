This file handles signal system calls and signal management for Darwin/macOS platform integration.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process signal system calls and signal management
- Handle signal delivery and signal handling
- Manage signal masking and signal coordination
- Process signal error handling and signal feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- signal_syscalls enables comprehensive signal system calls and signal management
- Proper signal handling ensures correct signal operations and user experience
- signal_syscalls support enables Runa compilation for Darwin signal workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Signal system calls and signal management
- Signal delivery and signal handling
- Signal masking and signal coordination
- Signal error handling and signal feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement signal_syscalls functionality
