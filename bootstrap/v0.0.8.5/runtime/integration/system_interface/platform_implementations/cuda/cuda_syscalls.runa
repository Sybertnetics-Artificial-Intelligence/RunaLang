Note:
This file implements CUDA syscalls for GPU kernel execution and memory management in the Runa runtime system interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process CUDA kernel launch syscalls and GPU execution management with thread block and grid configuration
- Handle CUDA memory management syscalls and GPU memory allocation with global, shared, and local memory
- Manage CUDA device management syscalls and GPU device enumeration with CUDA context management
- Process CUDA synchronization syscalls and GPU barrier operations with warp-level synchronization
- Handle CUDA stream management syscalls and GPU execution streams with asynchronous execution
- Process CUDA event management syscalls and GPU timing operations with performance monitoring
- Handle CUDA debugging syscalls and GPU error handling with CUDA-specific error reporting
- Process CUDA profiling syscalls and GPU performance monitoring with CUDA-specific profiling

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- cuda_syscalls enables comprehensive CUDA GPU system interface and kernel execution management
- Proper CUDA syscalls ensure correct GPU kernel execution and CUDA memory management
- cuda_syscalls support enables Runa runtime for advanced CUDA GPU programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- CUDA kernel launch syscalls and GPU execution management with thread block and grid configuration
- CUDA memory management syscalls and GPU memory allocation with global, shared, and local memory
- CUDA device management syscalls and GPU device enumeration with CUDA context management
- CUDA synchronization syscalls and GPU barrier operations with warp-level synchronization
- CUDA stream management syscalls and GPU execution streams with asynchronous execution
- CUDA event management syscalls and GPU timing operations with performance monitoring
- CUDA debugging syscalls and GPU error handling with CUDA-specific error reporting
- CUDA profiling syscalls and GPU performance monitoring with CUDA-specific profiling
