This file handles syscall management and system call orchestration for the Runa runtime system interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process syscall management and system call orchestration
- Handle syscall coordination and syscall management
- Manage syscall synchronization and syscall state management
- Process syscall error handling and syscall feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:

- Proper syscall management ensures correct system call coordination and user experience
- syscall_manager support enables Runa compilation for syscall management workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Syscall management and system call orchestration
- Syscall coordination and syscall management
- Syscall synchronization and syscall state management
- Syscall error handling and syscall feedback
