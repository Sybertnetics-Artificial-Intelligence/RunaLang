Note:
This file handles syscall batching and batch processing for the Runa runtime system interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process syscall batching and batch processing
- Handle batch optimization and batch coordination
- Manage batch synchronization and batch state management
- Process batch error handling and batch feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- syscall_batcher enables comprehensive syscall batching and batch processing
- Proper batch handling ensures correct performance optimization and user experience
- syscall_batcher support enables Runa compilation for batch processing workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Syscall batching and batch processing
- Batch optimization and batch coordination
- Batch synchronization and batch state management
- Batch error handling and batch feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement syscall_batcher functionality
