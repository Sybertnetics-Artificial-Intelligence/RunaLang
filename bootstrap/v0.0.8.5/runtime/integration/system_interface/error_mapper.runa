Note:
This file handles error mapping and error translation for the Runa runtime system interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process error mapping and error translation across platforms
- Handle platform-specific error codes and error coordination
- Manage error synchronization and error state management
- Process error handling and error feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- error_mapper enables comprehensive error mapping and error translation across platforms
- Proper error handling ensures correct error reporting and user experience
- error_mapper support enables Runa compilation for cross-platform error handling workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Error mapping and error translation across platforms
- Platform-specific error codes and error coordination
- Error synchronization and error state management
- Error handling and error feedback
