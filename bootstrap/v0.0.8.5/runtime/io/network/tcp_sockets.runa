Note:
This file handles TCP socket operations and TCP networking for the Runa runtime I/O system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process TCP socket operations and TCP networking
- Handle TCP connection management and TCP data transfer
- Manage TCP coordination and TCP synchronization
- Process TCP error handling and TCP feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- tcp_sockets enables comprehensive TCP socket operations and TCP networking
- Proper TCP handling ensures correct network operations and user experience
- tcp_sockets support enables Runa compilation for TCP networking workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- TCP socket operations and TCP networking
- TCP connection management and TCP data transfer
- TCP coordination and TCP synchronization
- TCP error handling and TCP feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement tcp_sockets functionality
