Note:
This file handles binary serialization and binary data conversion for the Runa runtime I/O system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process binary serialization and binary data conversion
- Handle binary encoding and binary decoding
- Manage binary coordination and binary synchronization
- Process binary error handling and binary feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- binary_serializer enables comprehensive binary serialization and binary data conversion
- Proper binary handling ensures correct data serialization and user experience
- binary_serializer support enables Runa compilation for binary serialization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Binary serialization and binary data conversion
- Binary encoding and binary decoding
- Binary coordination and binary synchronization
- Binary error handling and binary feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement binary_serializer functionality
