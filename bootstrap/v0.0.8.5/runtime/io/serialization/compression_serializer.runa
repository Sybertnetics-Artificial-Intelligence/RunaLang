Note:
This file handles compressed serialization and compression data conversion for the Runa runtime I/O system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process compressed serialization and compression data conversion
- Handle compression encoding and compression decoding
- Manage compression coordination and compression synchronization
- Process compression error handling and compression feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- compression_serializer enables comprehensive compressed serialization and compression data conversion
- Proper compression handling ensures correct compressed data serialization and user experience
- compression_serializer support enables Runa compilation for compressed serialization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Compressed serialization and compression data conversion
- Compression encoding and compression decoding
- Compression coordination and compression synchronization
- Compression error handling and compression feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement compression_serializer functionality
