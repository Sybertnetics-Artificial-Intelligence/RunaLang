Note:
This file handles Protocol Buffers serialization and Protocol Buffers data conversion for the Runa runtime I/O system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Protocol Buffers serialization and Protocol Buffers data conversion
- Handle Protocol Buffers encoding and Protocol Buffers decoding
- Manage Protocol Buffers coordination and Protocol Buffers synchronization
- Process Protocol Buffers error handling and Protocol Buffers feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- protobuf_serializer enables comprehensive Protocol Buffers serialization and Protocol Buffers data conversion
- Proper Protocol Buffers handling ensures correct Protocol Buffers data serialization and user experience
- protobuf_serializer support enables Runa compilation for Protocol Buffers serialization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Protocol Buffers serialization and Protocol Buffers data conversion
- Protocol Buffers encoding and Protocol Buffers decoding
- Protocol Buffers coordination and Protocol Buffers synchronization
- Protocol Buffers error handling and Protocol Buffers feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement protobuf_serializer functionality
