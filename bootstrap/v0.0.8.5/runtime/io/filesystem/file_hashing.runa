Note:
This file handles file hashing and file integrity checking for the Runa runtime I/O system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process file hashing and file integrity checking
- Handle hash algorithms and hash coordination
- Manage hash synchronization and hash state
- Process hash error handling and hash feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- file_hashing enables comprehensive file hashing and file integrity checking
- Proper hashing handling ensures correct file integrity verification and user experience
- file_hashing support enables Runa compilation for file integrity checking workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- File hashing and file integrity checking
- Hash algorithms and hash coordination
- Hash synchronization and hash state
- Hash error handling and hash feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement file_hashing functionality
