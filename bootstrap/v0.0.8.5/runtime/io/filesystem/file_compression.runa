Note:
This file handles file compression and decompression for the Runa runtime I/O system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process file compression and decompression
- Handle compression algorithms and compression coordination
- Manage compression synchronization and compression state
- Process compression error handling and compression feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- file_compression enables comprehensive file compression and decompression
- Proper compression handling ensures correct file compression and user experience
- file_compression support enables Runa compilation for file compression workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- File compression and decompression
- Compression algorithms and compression coordination
- Compression synchronization and compression state
- Compression error handling and compression feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement file_compression functionality
