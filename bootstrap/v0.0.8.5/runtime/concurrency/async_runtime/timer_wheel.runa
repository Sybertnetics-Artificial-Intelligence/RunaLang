Note:
This file handles timer wheel implementation and timer management for the Runa runtime concurrency system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process timer wheel implementation and timer management
- Handle timer scheduling and timer execution
- Manage timer expiration and timer coordination
- Process timer error handling and timer feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- timer_wheel enables comprehensive timer wheel implementation and timer management
- Proper timer handling ensures correct timer execution and user experience
- timer_wheel support enables Runa compilation for timer-based workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Timer wheel implementation and timer management
- Timer scheduling and timer execution
- Timer expiration and timer coordination
- Timer error handling and timer feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement timer_wheel functionality
