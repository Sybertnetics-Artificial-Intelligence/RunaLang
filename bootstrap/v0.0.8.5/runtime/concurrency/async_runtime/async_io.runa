Note:
This file handles asynchronous I/O operations and I/O event management for the Runa runtime concurrency system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process asynchronous I/O operations and I/O event management
- Handle I/O completion and I/O result processing
- Manage I/O event registration and I/O event dispatching
- Process I/O error handling and I/O feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- async_io enables comprehensive asynchronous I/O operations and I/O event management
- Proper async I/O handling ensures correct I/O performance and user experience
- async_io support enables Runa compilation for asynchronous I/O workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Asynchronous I/O operations and I/O event management
- I/O completion and I/O result processing
- I/O event registration and I/O event dispatching
- I/O error handling and I/O feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement async_io functionality
