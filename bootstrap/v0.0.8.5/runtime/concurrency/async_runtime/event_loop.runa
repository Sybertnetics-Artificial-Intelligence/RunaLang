Note:
This file handles event loop implementation and event loop management for the Runa runtime concurrency system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process event loop implementation and event loop management
- Handle event registration and event dispatching
- Manage event loop lifecycle and event loop coordination
- Process event loop error handling and event loop feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- event_loop enables comprehensive event loop implementation and event loop management
- Proper event loop handling ensures correct event processing and user experience
- event_loop support enables Runa compilation for event-driven workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Event loop implementation and event loop management
- Event registration and event dispatching
- Event loop lifecycle and event loop coordination
- Event loop error handling and event loop feedback
