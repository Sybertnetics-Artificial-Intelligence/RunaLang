Note:
This file handles reader-writer lock implementation and reader-writer lock management for the Runa runtime concurrency system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process reader-writer lock implementation and reader-writer lock management
- Handle read lock and write lock operations
- Manage reader-writer coordination and reader-writer synchronization
- Process reader-writer error handling and reader-writer feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- rwlock enables comprehensive reader-writer lock implementation and reader-writer lock management
- Proper reader-writer lock handling ensures correct reader-writer synchronization and user experience
- rwlock support enables Runa compilation for reader-writer lock-based workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Reader-writer lock implementation and reader-writer lock management
- Read lock and write lock operations
- Reader-writer coordination and reader-writer synchronization
- Reader-writer error handling and reader-writer feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement rwlock functionality
