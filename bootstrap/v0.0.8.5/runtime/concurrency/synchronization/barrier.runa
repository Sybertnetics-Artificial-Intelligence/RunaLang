Note:
This file handles barrier synchronization and barrier management for the Runa runtime concurrency system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process barrier synchronization and barrier management
- Handle barrier coordination and barrier synchronization
- Manage barrier waiting and barrier coordination
- Process barrier error handling and barrier feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- barrier enables comprehensive barrier synchronization and barrier management
- Proper barrier handling ensures correct barrier-based synchronization and user experience
- barrier support enables Runa compilation for barrier-based workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Barrier synchronization and barrier management
- Barrier coordination and barrier synchronization
- Barrier waiting and barrier coordination
- Barrier error handling and barrier feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement barrier functionality
