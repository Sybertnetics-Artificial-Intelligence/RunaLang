Note:
This file handles atomic operations and atomic synchronization for the Runa runtime concurrency system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process atomic operations and atomic synchronization
- Handle atomic memory operations and atomic coordination
- Manage atomic ordering and atomic consistency
- Process atomic error handling and atomic feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- atomic_operations enables comprehensive atomic operations and atomic synchronization
- Proper atomic handling ensures correct lock-free synchronization and user experience
- atomic_operations support enables Runa compilation for atomic-based workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Atomic operations and atomic synchronization
- Atomic memory operations and atomic coordination
- Atomic ordering and atomic consistency
- Atomic error handling and atomic feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement atomic_operations functionality
