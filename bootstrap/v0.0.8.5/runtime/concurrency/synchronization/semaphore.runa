Note:
This file handles semaphore implementation and semaphore management for the Runa runtime concurrency system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process semaphore implementation and semaphore management
- Handle semaphore acquisition and semaphore release
- Manage semaphore coordination and semaphore synchronization
- Process semaphore error handling and semaphore feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- semaphore enables comprehensive semaphore implementation and semaphore management
- Proper semaphore handling ensures correct semaphore-based synchronization and user experience
- semaphore support enables Runa compilation for semaphore-based workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Semaphore implementation and semaphore management
- Semaphore acquisition and semaphore release
- Semaphore coordination and semaphore synchronization
- Semaphore error handling and semaphore feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement semaphore functionality
