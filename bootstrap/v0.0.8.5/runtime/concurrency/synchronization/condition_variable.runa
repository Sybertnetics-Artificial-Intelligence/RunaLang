Note:
This file handles condition variable implementation and condition variable management for the Runa runtime concurrency system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process condition variable implementation and condition variable management
- Handle condition waiting and condition notification
- Manage condition coordination and condition synchronization
- Process condition error handling and condition feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- condition_variable enables comprehensive condition variable implementation and condition variable management
- Proper condition variable handling ensures correct condition-based synchronization and user experience
- condition_variable support enables Runa compilation for condition-based workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Condition variable implementation and condition variable management
- Condition waiting and condition notification
- Condition coordination and condition synchronization
- Condition error handling and condition feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement condition_variable functionality
