Note:
This file handles garbage collector tuning and optimization for the Runa runtime tools.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process garbage collector tuning and optimization
- Handle GC tuning operations and GC tuning coordination
- Manage GC tuning synchronization and GC tuning state
- Process GC tuning error handling and GC tuning feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- gc_tuner enables comprehensive garbage collector tuning and optimization
- Proper GC tuning handling ensures correct garbage collection performance and user experience
- gc_tuner support enables Runa compilation for garbage collector tuning workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Garbage collector tuning and optimization
- GC tuning operations and GC tuning coordination
- GC tuning synchronization and GC tuning state
- GC tuning error handling and GC tuning feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement gc_tuner functionality
