Note:
This file handles cache performance optimization and tuning for the Runa runtime tools.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process cache performance optimization and tuning
- Handle cache optimization operations and cache optimization coordination
- Manage cache optimization synchronization and cache optimization state
- Process cache optimization error handling and cache optimization feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- cache_optimizer enables comprehensive cache performance optimization and tuning
- Proper cache optimization handling ensures correct cache performance and user experience
- cache_optimizer support enables Runa compilation for cache optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Cache performance optimization and tuning
- Cache optimization operations and cache optimization coordination
- Cache optimization synchronization and cache optimization state
- Cache optimization error handling and cache optimization feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement cache_optimizer functionality
