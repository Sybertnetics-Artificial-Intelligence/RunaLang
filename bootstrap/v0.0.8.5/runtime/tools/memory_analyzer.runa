Note:
This file handles memory usage analysis and leak detection for the Runa runtime tools.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process memory usage analysis and leak detection
- Handle memory analysis operations and memory analysis coordination
- Manage memory analysis synchronization and memory analysis state
- Process memory analysis error handling and memory analysis feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- memory_analyzer enables comprehensive memory usage analysis and leak detection
- Proper memory analysis handling ensures correct memory monitoring and user experience
- memory_analyzer support enables Runa compilation for memory analysis workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Memory usage analysis and leak detection
- Memory analysis operations and memory analysis coordination
- Memory analysis synchronization and memory analysis state
- Memory analysis error handling and memory analysis feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement memory_analyzer functionality
