Note:
This file handles runtime startup time optimization for the Runa runtime tools.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process runtime startup time optimization
- Handle startup optimization operations and startup optimization coordination
- Manage startup optimization synchronization and startup optimization state
- Process startup optimization error handling and startup optimization feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- startup_optimizer enables comprehensive runtime startup time optimization
- Proper startup optimization handling ensures correct startup performance and user experience
- startup_optimizer support enables Runa compilation for startup optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Runtime startup time optimization
- Startup optimization operations and startup optimization coordination
- Startup optimization synchronization and startup optimization state
- Startup optimization error handling and startup optimization feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement startup_optimizer functionality
