Note:
This file handles resource usage optimization and tuning for the Runa runtime tools.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process resource usage optimization and tuning
- Handle resource optimization operations and resource optimization coordination
- Manage resource optimization synchronization and resource optimization state
- Process resource optimization error handling and resource optimization feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- resource_optimizer enables comprehensive resource usage optimization and tuning
- Proper resource optimization handling ensures correct resource usage and user experience
- resource_optimizer support enables Runa compilation for resource optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Resource usage optimization and tuning
- Resource optimization operations and resource optimization coordination
- Resource optimization synchronization and resource optimization state
- Resource optimization error handling and resource optimization feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement resource_optimizer functionality
