Note:
This file implements the core deoptimization engine for the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process speculation failure detection and handling with live deoptimization support
- Handle state reconstruction from optimized to interpretable form with minimal overhead
- Manage guard failure recovery and fallback execution with performance impact minimization
- Process deoptimization metadata management and multi-tier coordination
- Handle emergency deoptimization and hot-swapping support for live code updates

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- deopt_engine enables comprehensive speculation failure handling and adaptive optimization
- Proper deoptimization handling ensures correct runtime stability and performance recovery
- deopt_engine support enables Runa runtime for advanced adaptive optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Speculation failure detection and handling with live deoptimization support
- State reconstruction from optimized to interpretable form with minimal overhead
- Guard failure recovery and fallback execution with performance impact minimization
- Deoptimization metadata management and multi-tier coordination
- Emergency deoptimization and hot-swapping support for live code updates
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement deopt_engine functionality
