Note:
This file implements comprehensive state reconstruction capabilities for deoptimization in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process variable mapping from optimized to interpreter locations and register state reconstruction
- Handle stack frame unwinding and memory state synchronization with consistency checking
- Manage live variable analysis and dead code elimination reversal with optimized code mapping
- Process multi-tier state consistency verification and performance-optimized reconstruction algorithms
- Handle error handling and recovery for reconstruction failures with state reconstruction caching

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- state_reconstruction enables comprehensive execution state recovery and deoptimization support
- Proper state reconstruction ensures correct runtime state consistency and optimization safety
- state_reconstruction support enables Runa runtime for advanced deoptimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Variable mapping from optimized to interpreter locations and register state reconstruction
- Stack frame unwinding and memory state synchronization with consistency checking
- Live variable analysis and dead code elimination reversal with optimized code mapping
- Multi-tier state consistency verification and performance-optimized reconstruction algorithms
- Error handling and recovery for reconstruction failures with state reconstruction caching
