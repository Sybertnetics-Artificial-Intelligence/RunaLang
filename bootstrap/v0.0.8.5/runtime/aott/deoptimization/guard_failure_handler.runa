Note:
This file implements comprehensive guard failure handling for the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process speculation guard monitoring and failure detection with adaptive threshold management
- Handle guard failure analysis and classification with recovery strategy execution
- Manage performance impact assessment and statistical analysis of guard effectiveness
- Process guard optimization and refinement based on failure patterns and predictive models
- Handle multi-tier guard coordination and emergency guard disabling for critical failures

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- guard_failure_handler enables comprehensive speculation guard management and failure recovery
- Proper guard handling ensures correct speculative optimization stability and performance
- guard_failure_handler support enables Runa runtime for advanced speculative optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Speculation guard monitoring and failure detection with adaptive threshold management
- Guard failure analysis and classification with recovery strategy execution
- Performance impact assessment and statistical analysis of guard effectiveness
- Guard optimization and refinement based on failure patterns and predictive models
- Multi-tier guard coordination and emergency guard disabling for critical failures
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement guard_failure_handler functionality
