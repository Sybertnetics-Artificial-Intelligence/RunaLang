Note:
This file implements frame-level deoptimization for the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process stack frame analysis and unwinding for deoptimization with state reconstruction
- Handle frame-by-frame state reconstruction and optimized to interpreter frame conversion
- Manage call stack consistency maintenance and frame metadata preservation
- Process exception handling frame unwinding and inline frame expansion
- Handle multi-level frame deoptimization coordination and performance optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- frame_deoptimization enables comprehensive frame-level state recovery and deoptimization
- Proper frame handling ensures correct execution state reconstruction and consistency
- frame_deoptimization support enables Runa runtime for advanced deoptimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Stack frame analysis and unwinding for deoptimization with state reconstruction
- Frame-by-frame state reconstruction and optimized to interpreter frame conversion
- Call stack consistency maintenance and frame metadata preservation
- Exception handling frame unwinding and inline frame expansion
- Multi-level frame deoptimization coordination and performance optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement frame_deoptimization functionality
