Note:
This file implements comprehensive statistics collection and analysis for deoptimization in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process real-time deoptimization event tracking and performance impact analysis
- Handle guard failure pattern analysis and optimization insights generation
- Manage tier transition statistics and resource consumption tracking
- Process predictive analytics and machine learning-driven insight extraction
- Handle historical analysis and cross-application pattern comparison

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- deopt_statistics enables comprehensive deoptimization performance analysis and optimization feedback
- Proper statistics collection ensures correct optimization decision making and system tuning
- deopt_statistics support enables Runa runtime for advanced performance analysis workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Real-time deoptimization event tracking and performance impact analysis
- Guard failure pattern analysis and optimization insights generation
- Tier transition statistics and resource consumption tracking
- Predictive analytics and machine learning-driven insight extraction
- Historical analysis and cross-application pattern comparison
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement deopt_statistics functionality
