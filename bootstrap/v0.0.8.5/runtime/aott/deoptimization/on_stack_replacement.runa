Note:
This file implements On-Stack Replacement (OSR) capabilities for the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process live code replacement without stack unwinding and OSR point identification
- Handle state mapping between different optimization levels and hot loop replacement
- Manage seamless tier transitions during execution and OSR safety verification
- Process performance monitoring and feedback collection with rollback mechanisms
- Handle multi-threaded OSR coordination and memory-efficient implementation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- on_stack_replacement enables comprehensive live code optimization and tier transitions
- Proper OSR handling ensures correct runtime optimization without execution interruption
- on_stack_replacement support enables Runa runtime for advanced live optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Live code replacement without stack unwinding and OSR point identification
- State mapping between different optimization levels and hot loop replacement
- Seamless tier transitions during execution and OSR safety verification
- Performance monitoring and feedback collection with rollback mechanisms
- Multi-threaded OSR coordination and memory-efficient implementation

Note: TODO - Implement on_stack_replacement functionality
