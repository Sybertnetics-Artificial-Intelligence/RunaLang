Note:
This file implements the AOTT tier transition management system for the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process promotion and demotion between the 5 optimization tiers and tier-specific compilation
- Handle deoptimization and tier fallback mechanisms with execution state reconstruction
- Manage tier promotion policies and demotion policies with performance-based decisions
- Process tier transition validation and safety verification with rollback support
- Handle tier statistics collection and performance trend analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- tier_manager enables comprehensive tier transition management and optimization level coordination
- Proper tier management ensures correct optimization progression and performance improvement
- tier_manager support enables Runa compilation for advanced tiered optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Tier promotion and demotion request processing with priority-based scheduling
- Deoptimization handling and execution state reconstruction for failed optimizations
- Tier transition validation and safety verification with rollback capabilities
- Tier performance analysis and promotion threshold adjustment
- Tier statistics collection and optimization recommendation generation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement tier_manager functionality
