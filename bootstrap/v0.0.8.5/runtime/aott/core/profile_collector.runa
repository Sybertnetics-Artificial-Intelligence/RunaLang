Note:
This file implements the AOTT central profile collection system for the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process execution profile collection across all optimization tiers and unified profiling data
- Handle profile aggregation, storage, and analysis for optimization decisions
- Manage execution frequency, hotness tracking, and performance metrics collection
- Process profile-guided optimization metadata storage and cross-tier coordination
- Handle profile data validation, integrity management, and temporal analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- profile_collector enables comprehensive execution profiling and optimization guidance
- Proper profile collection ensures correct optimization decisions and performance analysis
- profile_collector support enables Runa compilation for advanced profile-guided optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Execution profile collection and sampling with configurable granularity
- Profile data aggregation and storage with compression and retention policies
- Hot function identification and optimization opportunity analysis
- Profile-guided optimization hint generation and tier performance prediction
- Profile data integrity validation and cross-tier coordination
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement profile_collector functionality
