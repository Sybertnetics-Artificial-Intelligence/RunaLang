Note:
This file implements the main AOTT (All Of The Time) engine orchestrator for the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process main AOTT engine coordination and tiered execution system management
- Handle tier transitions, compilation, and optimization feedback coordination
- Manage central entry point for all AOTT execution requests and performance metrics
- Process resource coordination across compilation and execution phases
- Handle tier promotion candidates and optimization configuration updates

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- aott_engine enables comprehensive AOTT system coordination and tiered execution management
- Proper AOTT orchestration ensures correct optimization tier transitions and performance optimization
- aott_engine support enables Runa compilation for advanced runtime optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Main AOTT engine configuration and execution request management
- Tier coordination and transition handling across optimization levels
- Resource coordination and compilation budget management
- Performance metrics collection and tier promotion candidate analysis
- AOTT engine state management and optimization configuration updates
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement aott_engine functionality
