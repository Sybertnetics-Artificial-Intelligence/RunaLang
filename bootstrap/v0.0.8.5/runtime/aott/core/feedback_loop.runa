Note:
This file implements the AOTT optimization feedback system for the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process feedback-driven optimization decisions across all optimization tiers
- Handle optimization effectiveness tracking and adaptive optimization management
- Manage closed-loop optimization control for maximum performance and learning
- Process performance analysis and optimization strategy comparison
- Handle system adaptation and exploration vs exploitation balance adjustment

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- feedback_loop enables comprehensive feedback-driven optimization and adaptive performance management
- Proper feedback processing ensures correct optimization decisions and performance improvement
- feedback_loop support enables Runa compilation for advanced adaptive optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Optimization feedback collection and decision processing with learning algorithms
- Performance trend analysis and regression identification
- Adaptive optimization parameter adjustment and pattern learning
- System behavior adaptation and exploration balance management
- Feedback loop health monitoring and diagnostics
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement feedback_loop functionality
