Note:
This file implements the AOTT compilation lifecycle management system for the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process compilation coordination across all optimization tiers and compilation scheduling
- Handle compilation caching, resource allocation, and background compilation management
- Manage incremental compilation updates and compilation job state tracking
- Process compilation scheduling policies and dependency resolution
- Handle triple syntax compilation pipeline integration and syntax-aware optimizations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- compilation_manager enables comprehensive compilation lifecycle management across optimization tiers
- Proper compilation coordination ensures correct resource allocation and compilation efficiency
- compilation_manager support enables Runa compilation for advanced compilation workflow management

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Compilation request submission and job management with priority scheduling
- Compilation caching and dependency tracking for incremental updates
- Background compilation and resource allocation coordination
- Triple syntax compilation pipeline with syntax-aware optimization support
- Compilation statistics and performance monitoring
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement compilation_manager functionality
