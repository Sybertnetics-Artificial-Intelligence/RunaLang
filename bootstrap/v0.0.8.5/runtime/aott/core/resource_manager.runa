Note:
This file implements the AOTT resource management system for the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process computational resource management across all optimization tiers and resource allocation
- Handle memory, CPU, and compilation budget coordination for optimal performance
- Manage resource monitoring, enforcement, and pressure mitigation strategies
- Process tier-specific resource allocation and speculation budget management
- Handle resource optimization for throughput, latency, and workload adaptation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- resource_manager enables comprehensive resource management and allocation optimization
- Proper resource coordination ensures correct compilation and execution efficiency
- resource_manager support enables Runa compilation for advanced resource optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Resource allocation request processing and scheduling with priority management
- Resource usage monitoring and bottleneck analysis with anomaly detection
- Resource limit enforcement and violation handling with preemption support
- Tier-specific resource allocation and speculation budget coordination
- Resource optimization and cost-benefit analysis with recommendation generation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement resource_manager functionality
