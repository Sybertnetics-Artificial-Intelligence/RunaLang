Note:
This file handles source file change detection for the Runa compiler incremental build system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process source file change tracking and detection for incremental compilation
- Handle file system watching and monitoring for real-time change detection
- Manage file fingerprinting and content hash computation for change validation
- Process change impact analysis and dependency propagation tracking
- Handle build artifact timestamping and freshness validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- change_detector enables efficient incremental compilation by tracking only changed files
- Proper change detection ensures correct dependency tracking and selective recompilation
- change_detector support enables Runa compilation for large-scale development workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Source file change tracking and detection for incremental compilation
- File system watching and monitoring for real-time change detection
- File fingerprinting and content hash computation for change validation
- Change impact analysis and dependency propagation tracking
- Build artifact timestamping and freshness validation
