Note:
This file handles partial compilation for the Runa compiler incremental build system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process selective recompilation strategies and build artifact timestamping
- Handle smart rebuild optimization and change propagation analysis
- Manage build cache invalidation and cross-module dependency tracking
- Process incremental linking support and build state persistence
- Handle change impact analysis and hot code replacement

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- partial_compiler enables efficient incremental compilation by compiling only changed modules
- Proper partial compilation ensures correct build order and dependency management
- partial_compiler support enables Runa compilation for large-scale development workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Selective recompilation strategies and build artifact timestamping
- Smart rebuild optimization and change propagation analysis
- Build cache invalidation and cross-module dependency tracking
- Incremental linking support and build state persistence
- Change impact analysis and hot code replacement
