Note:
This file handles compilation cache management for the Runa compiler incremental build system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process compilation artifact caching and multi-level cache hierarchy management
- Handle source file change detection and dependency-aware invalidation
- Manage cache compression, deduplication, and distributed cache support
- Process cache metadata tracking and cache warming strategies
- Handle cache eviction policies and cross-compilation cache isolation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- cache_manager enables comprehensive compilation caching for faster incremental builds
- Proper cache management ensures correct dependency tracking and build artifact reuse
- cache_manager support enables Runa compilation for large-scale development workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Compilation artifact caching and multi-level cache hierarchy management
- Source file change detection and dependency-aware invalidation
- Cache compression, deduplication, and distributed cache support
- Cache metadata tracking and cache warming strategies
- Cache eviction policies and cross-compilation cache isolation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement cache_manager functionality
