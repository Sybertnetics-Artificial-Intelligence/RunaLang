Note:
This file handles dependency tracking and management for the Runa compiler incremental build system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process module dependency resolution and package dependency tracking
- Handle dependency graph construction and circular dependency detection
- Manage version constraint solving and external dependency fetching
- Process dependency caching and version conflict resolution
- Handle transitive dependency handling and optional dependency support

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- dependency_tracker enables comprehensive dependency management for incremental builds
- Proper dependency tracking ensures correct build order and change propagation
- dependency_tracker support enables Runa compilation for complex project structures

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Module dependency resolution and package dependency tracking
- Dependency graph construction and circular dependency detection
- Version constraint solving and external dependency fetching
- Dependency caching and version conflict resolution
- Transitive dependency handling and optional dependency support
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement dependency_tracker functionality
