Note:
This file handles loop invariant code motion optimization for the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process loop invariant code motion and loop optimization analysis
- Handle loop detection and loop structure analysis
- Manage invariant expression identification and hoisting
- Process loop unrolling and loop fusion optimization
- Handle induction variable optimization and strength reduction

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- loop_invariant enables movement of invariant computations outside loops for performance
- Proper LICM ensures correct program semantics while reducing redundant computation
- loop_invariant support enables Runa compilation for performance-critical applications

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Loop invariant code motion and loop optimization analysis
- Loop detection and loop structure analysis
- Invariant expression identification and hoisting
- Loop unrolling and loop fusion optimization
- Induction variable optimization and strength reduction
