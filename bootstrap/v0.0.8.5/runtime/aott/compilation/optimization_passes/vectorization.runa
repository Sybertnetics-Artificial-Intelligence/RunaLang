Note:
This file handles vectorization optimization for the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process vectorization and parallelization transformations
- Handle loop vectorization and SIMD instruction generation
- Manage data parallelism detection and vector instruction selection
- Process auto-vectorization and manual vectorization support
- Handle vectorization analysis and performance optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- vectorization enables parallel execution of operations for performance optimization
- Proper vectorization ensures correct program semantics while improving throughput
- vectorization support enables Runa compilation for high-performance computing

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Vectorization and parallelization transformations
- Loop vectorization and SIMD instruction generation
- Data parallelism detection and vector instruction selection
- Auto-vectorization and manual vectorization support
- Vectorization analysis and performance optimization
