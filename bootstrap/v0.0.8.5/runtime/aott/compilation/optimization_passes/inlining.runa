Note:
This file handles function inlining optimization for the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process function inlining decisions and call site analysis
- Handle inlining cost-benefit analysis and size threshold management
- Manage parameter substitution and return value handling
- Process recursive inlining and inlining depth control
- Handle profile-guided inlining and hot path optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- inlining enables elimination of function call overhead for performance optimization
- Proper inlining ensures correct program semantics while reducing execution time
- inlining support enables Runa compilation for performance-critical applications

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Function inlining decisions and call site analysis
- Inlining cost-benefit analysis and size threshold management
- Parameter substitution and return value handling
- Recursive inlining and inlining depth control
- Profile-guided inlining and hot path optimization
