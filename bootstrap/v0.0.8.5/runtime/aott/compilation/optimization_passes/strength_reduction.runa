Note:
This file handles strength reduction optimization for the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process strength reduction and algebraic simplifications
- Handle multiplication by constants optimization and shift operations
- Manage division by constants optimization and reciprocal multiplication
- Process induction variable strength reduction and loop optimization
- Handle address computation optimization and memory access patterns

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- strength_reduction enables replacement of expensive operations with cheaper equivalents
- Proper strength reduction ensures correct program semantics while improving performance
- strength_reduction support enables Runa compilation for performance-critical applications

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Strength reduction and algebraic simplifications
- Multiplication by constants optimization and shift operations
- Division by constants optimization and reciprocal multiplication
- Induction variable strength reduction and loop optimization
- Address computation optimization and memory access patterns
