Note:
This file handles dead code elimination optimization for the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process dead code elimination and unreachable code removal
- Handle liveness analysis and use-def chain analysis for dead instruction detection
- Manage unreachable basic block elimination and control flow optimization
- Process dead store elimination and redundant computation removal
- Handle side-effect analysis and safe dead code elimination

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- dead_code_elimination enables removal of unused code for performance and size optimization
- Proper DCE ensures correct program semantics while reducing code size and execution time
- dead_code_elimination support enables Runa compilation for performance-critical applications

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Dead code elimination and unreachable code removal
- Liveness analysis and use-def chain analysis for dead instruction detection
- Unreachable basic block elimination and control flow optimization
- Dead store elimination and redundant computation removal
- Side-effect analysis and safe dead code elimination
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement dead_code_elimination functionality
