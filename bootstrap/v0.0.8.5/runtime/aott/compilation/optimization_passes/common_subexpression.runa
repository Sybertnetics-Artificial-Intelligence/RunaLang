Note:
This file handles common subexpression elimination optimization for the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process common subexpression elimination with value numbering analysis
- Handle redundant computation detection and elimination across basic blocks
- Manage expression equivalence analysis and semantic value tracking
- Process global value numbering and expression canonicalization
- Handle cross-procedure common subexpression elimination

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- common_subexpression enables elimination of redundant computations for performance optimization
- Proper CSE ensures correct program semantics while reducing execution time
- common_subexpression support enables Runa compilation for performance-critical applications

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Common subexpression elimination with value numbering analysis
- Redundant computation detection and elimination across basic blocks
- Expression equivalence analysis and semantic value tracking
- Global value numbering and expression canonicalization
- Cross-procedure common subexpression elimination
