Note:
This file handles constant folding optimization for the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process constant folding and propagation across basic blocks
- Handle compile-time constant evaluation and expression simplification
- Manage constant propagation through SSA use-def chains
- Process sparse conditional constant propagation and constant analysis
- Handle algebraic simplification and identity operation elimination

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- constant_folding enables compile-time evaluation of constant expressions for performance
- Proper constant folding ensures correct program semantics while reducing runtime overhead
- constant_folding support enables Runa compilation for performance-critical applications

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Constant folding and propagation across basic blocks
- Compile-time constant evaluation and expression simplification
- Constant propagation through SSA use-def chains
- Sparse conditional constant propagation and constant analysis
- Algebraic simplification and identity operation elimination
