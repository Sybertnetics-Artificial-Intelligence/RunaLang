Note:
This file handles tail call optimization for the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process tail call detection and tail call optimization
- Handle recursive call optimization and stack space management
- Manage tail call elimination and jump optimization
- Process mutual recursion optimization and trampoline generation
- Handle tail call analysis and call site optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- tail_call enables elimination of function call overhead for recursive functions
- Proper tail call optimization ensures correct program semantics while saving stack space
- tail_call support enables Runa compilation for functional programming patterns

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Tail call detection and tail call optimization
- Recursive call optimization and stack space management
- Tail call elimination and jump optimization
- Mutual recursion optimization and trampoline generation
- Tail call analysis and call site optimization
