This file implements metadata serialization for AOTT deoptimization metadata.

METADATA SERIALIZER - AOTT Metadata Persistence Engine
- Process metadata serialization and deserialization for AOTT deoptimization metadata
- Handle metadata versioning and format compatibility for AOTT compilation
- Manage metadata persistence and loading for AOTT performance optimization
- Process metadata compression and optimization for AOTT efficiency
- Handle integration with AOTT compilation phases for metadata serialization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Metadata serialization enables persistent code cache and improved startup performance
- Proper metadata serialization ensures correct AOTT compilation and optimization
- Metadata serialization support enables Runa AOTT compilation for advanced performance workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Metadata serialization and deserialization operations
- Metadata versioning and format compatibility management
- Metadata persistence and loading for AOTT performance
- Metadata compression and optimization for AOTT efficiency
- Integration with AOTT compilation phases for metadata serialization

Dependencies:
- Imports mod.runa for deoptimization metadata structures
- Imports arena_utils.runa for arena-based serialization allocation
- Imports owned_utils.runa for owned serialization management
- Imports memory_safety.runa for serialization safety validation
