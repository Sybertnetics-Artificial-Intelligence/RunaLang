This file implements PowerPC specific state mapping for AOTT deoptimization.

POWERPC STATE MAPPING - Platform-Specific State Analysis Engine
- Process PowerPC specific state mapping between optimized machine state and logical Runa state
- Handle PowerPC register allocation and calling convention analysis for deoptimization
- Manage PowerPC specific state mapping generation and validation for AOTT compilation
- Process PowerPC state mapping optimization and performance analysis for AOTT efficiency
- Handle integration with AOTT compilation phases for PowerPC state mapping generation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- PowerPC state mapping enables comprehensive deoptimization support for PowerPC platforms
- Proper PowerPC state mapping ensures correct program execution during optimization failures
- PowerPC state mapping support enables Runa AOTT compilation for advanced PowerPC optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- PowerPC specific state mapping between optimized and logical execution states
- PowerPC register allocation and calling convention analysis
- PowerPC state mapping generation and validation for AOTT compilation
- PowerPC state mapping optimization and performance analysis
- Integration with AOTT compilation phases for PowerPC state mapping generation

Dependencies:
- Imports mod.runa for deoptimization metadata structures
- Imports state_mapper.runa for base state mapping functionality
