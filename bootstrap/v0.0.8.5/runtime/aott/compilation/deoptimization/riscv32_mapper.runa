This file implements RISC-V 32-bit specific state mapping for AOTT deoptimization.

RISCV32 STATE MAPPING - Platform-Specific State Analysis Engine
- Process RISC-V 32-bit specific state mapping between optimized machine state and logical Runa state
- Handle RISC-V 32-bit register allocation and calling convention analysis for deoptimization
- Manage RISC-V 32-bit specific state mapping generation and validation for AOTT compilation
- Process RISC-V 32-bit state mapping optimization and performance analysis for AOTT efficiency
- Handle integration with AOTT compilation phases for RISC-V 32-bit state mapping generation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- RISC-V 32-bit state mapping enables comprehensive deoptimization support for RISC-V 32-bit platforms
- Proper RISC-V 32-bit state mapping ensures correct program execution during optimization failures
- RISC-V 32-bit state mapping support enables Runa AOTT compilation for advanced RISC-V 32-bit optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- RISC-V 32-bit specific state mapping between optimized and logical execution states
- RISC-V 32-bit register allocation and calling convention analysis
- RISC-V 32-bit state mapping generation and validation for AOTT compilation
- RISC-V 32-bit state mapping optimization and performance analysis
