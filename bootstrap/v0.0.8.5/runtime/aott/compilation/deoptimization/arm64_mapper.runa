This file implements ARM64-specific state mapping for AOTT deoptimization.

ARM64 STATE MAPPING - Platform-Specific State Analysis Engine
- Process ARM64-specific state mapping between optimized machine state and logical Runa state
- Handle ARM64 register allocation and calling convention analysis for deoptimization
- Manage ARM64-specific state mapping generation and validation for AOTT compilation
- Process ARM64 state mapping optimization and performance analysis for AOTT efficiency
- Handle integration with AOTT compilation phases for ARM64 state mapping generation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- ARM64 state mapping enables comprehensive deoptimization support for ARM64 platforms
- Proper ARM64 state mapping ensures correct program execution during optimization failures
- ARM64 state mapping support enables Runa AOTT compilation for advanced ARM64 optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- ARM64-specific state mapping between optimized and logical execution states
- ARM64 register allocation and calling convention analysis
- ARM64 state mapping generation and validation for AOTT compilation
- ARM64 state mapping optimization and performance analysis
- Integration with AOTT compilation phases for ARM64 state mapping generation

Dependencies:
- Imports mod.runa for deoptimization metadata structures
- Imports state_mapper.runa for base state mapping functionality
- Imports arena_utils.runa for arena-based state mapping allocation
- Imports owned_utils.runa for owned state mapping management
