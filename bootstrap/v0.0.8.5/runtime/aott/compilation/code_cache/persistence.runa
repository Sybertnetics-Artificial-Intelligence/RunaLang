Note:
This file implements persistent storage for the AOTT compiled code cache system in the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process durable storage of compilation artifacts and optimization metadata across sessions
- Handle incremental cache updates and compression with integrity verification
- Manage cache recovery mechanisms and storage optimization strategies
- Process cache persistence write strategies and storage directory management
- Handle integration with cache manager and compilation system coordination

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- persistence enables comprehensive cache durability and fast startup performance
- Proper cache persistence ensures correct compilation artifact preservation and recovery
- persistence support enables Runa compilation for advanced cache management workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Durable storage of compilation artifacts and optimization metadata across sessions
- Incremental cache updates and compression with integrity verification
- Cache recovery mechanisms and storage optimization strategies
- Cache persistence write strategies and storage directory management
- Integration with cache manager and compilation system coordination
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement persistence functionality
