Note:
This file implements high-performance cache management for compiled code artifacts in the AOTT system in the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process multi-level cache hierarchy management and compiled code artifact storage
- Handle cache lookup, eviction, and persistence with efficient memory management
- Manage cache coherency protocols and incremental compilation integration
- Process cache compression and performance monitoring with resource optimization
- Handle integration with compilation system and optimization metadata caching

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- cache_manager enables comprehensive compiled code artifact management and performance optimization
- Proper cache management ensures correct compilation performance and memory efficiency
- cache_manager support enables Runa compilation for advanced caching and optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Multi-level cache hierarchy management and compiled code artifact storage
- Cache lookup, eviction, and persistence with efficient memory management
- Cache coherency protocols and incremental compilation integration
- Cache compression and performance monitoring with resource optimization
- Integration with compilation system and optimization metadata caching
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement cache_manager functionality
