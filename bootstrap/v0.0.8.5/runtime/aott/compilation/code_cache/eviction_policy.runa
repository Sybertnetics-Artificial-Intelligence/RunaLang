Note:
This file implements various cache eviction policies for the AOTT compiled code cache system in the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process cache eviction strategy implementation and memory pressure management
- Handle access pattern analysis and eviction candidate selection optimization
- Manage compilation cost consideration and eviction decision algorithms
- Process adaptive eviction policy coordination and performance optimization
- Handle integration with cache manager and resource constraint management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- eviction_policy enables comprehensive cache memory management and performance optimization
- Proper eviction handling ensures correct cache hit rates and compilation performance
- eviction_policy support enables Runa compilation for advanced memory management workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Cache eviction strategy implementation and memory pressure management
- Access pattern analysis and eviction candidate selection optimization
- Compilation cost consideration and eviction decision algorithms
- Adaptive eviction policy coordination and performance optimization
- Integration with cache manager and resource constraint management
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement eviction_policy functionality
