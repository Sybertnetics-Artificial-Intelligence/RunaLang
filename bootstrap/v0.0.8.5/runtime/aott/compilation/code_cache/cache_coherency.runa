Note:
This file implements cache coherency protocols for the AOTT compiled code cache system in the Runa compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process cache coherency protocol implementation and multi-level cache consistency management
- Handle concurrent access coordination and cache invalidation across compilation threads
- Manage coherency message processing and conflict resolution for cache operations
- Process cache level coordination and consistency verification with minimal performance overhead
- Handle integration with incremental compilation and cache invalidation operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- cache_coherency enables comprehensive multi-threaded cache access and consistency management
- Proper cache coherency handling ensures correct compilation artifact consistency and performance
- cache_coherency support enables Runa compilation for advanced multi-threaded compilation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Cache coherency protocol implementation and multi-level cache consistency management
- Concurrent access coordination and cache invalidation across compilation threads
- Coherency message processing and conflict resolution for cache operations
- Cache level coordination and consistency verification with performance optimization
- Integration with incremental compilation and cache invalidation operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement cache_coherency functionality
