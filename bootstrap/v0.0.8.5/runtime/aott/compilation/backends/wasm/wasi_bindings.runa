This file implements WASI bindings for WebAssembly AOTT runtime compilation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) binding generation and host function integration
- Handle system call interface mapping and file system operations with network operations
- Manage process and thread management with memory management and security operations
- Process integration with AOTT tier system for WASI optimization and profile-guided WASI binding optimization
- Handle WASI proposal support and custom WASI extensions for Runa-specific functionality
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- Handle WASI debugging support and performance monitoring with WASI-specific optimizations
- Process integration with WebAssembly runtime and host environment coordination

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- wasi_bindings enables comprehensive WASI binding generation and WebAssembly system interface integration
- Proper WASI bindings ensure correct system call interface mapping and host function integration
- wasi_bindings support enables Runa runtime for advanced WebAssembly system interface workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) binding generation and host function integration
- System call interface mapping and file system operations with network operations
- Process and thread management with memory management and security operations
- Integration with AOTT tier system for WASI optimization and profile-guided WASI binding optimization
- WASI proposal support and custom WASI extensions for Runa-specific functionality
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- WASI debugging support and performance monitoring with WASI-specific optimizations
- Integration with WebAssembly runtime and host environment coordination
