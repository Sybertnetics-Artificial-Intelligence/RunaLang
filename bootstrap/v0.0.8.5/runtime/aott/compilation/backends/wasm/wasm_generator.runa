Note:
This file implements WebAssembly code generation for AOTT runtime compilation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process direct WebAssembly module generation from Runa bytecode with WebAssembly binary format (WASM) and text format (WAT) support
- Handle integration with WebAssembly SIMD proposal for vectorization and integration with WebAssembly Threading and Atomics proposals
- Manage WebAssembly Component Model support for modular compilation and memory management with linear memory and memory64 extension
- Process table management for indirect function calls and import/export management for host function integration
- Handle integration with AOTT tier system for progressive optimization and profile-guided code generation with speculation support
- Process deoptimization metadata generation for safe speculation and exception handling using WebAssembly Exception Handling proposal
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- Process support for WebAssembly GC proposal for managed objects and integration with WASI for system interface compatibility
- Handle custom section generation for Runa-specific metadata and debugging support with WebAssembly Debug Information

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- wasm_generator enables comprehensive WebAssembly code generation and AOTT runtime compilation
- Proper WebAssembly code generation ensures correct WASM binary format generation and SIMD vectorization
- wasm_generator support enables Runa runtime for advanced WebAssembly compilation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Direct WebAssembly module generation from Runa bytecode with WebAssembly binary format (WASM) and text format (WAT) support
- Integration with WebAssembly SIMD proposal for vectorization and integration with WebAssembly Threading and Atomics proposals
- WebAssembly Component Model support for modular compilation and memory management with linear memory and memory64 extension
- Table management for indirect function calls and import/export management for host function integration
- Integration with AOTT tier system for progressive optimization and profile-guided code generation with speculation support
- Deoptimization metadata generation for safe speculation and exception handling using WebAssembly Exception Handling proposal
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- Support for WebAssembly GC proposal for managed objects and integration with WASI for system interface compatibility
- Custom section generation for Runa-specific metadata and debugging support with WebAssembly Debug Information
