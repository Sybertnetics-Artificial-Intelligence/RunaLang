Note:
This file implements WebAssembly optimization for AOTT runtime compilation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process WebAssembly-specific peephole optimizations and stack machine optimization and local variable promotion
- Handle control flow optimization and dead code elimination with memory access optimization and coalescing
- Manage function inlining and call site optimization with SIMD instruction optimization and vectorization
- Process integration with AOTT tier system for optimization strategies and profile-guided optimization decisions
- Handle size optimization for better network transfer and performance optimization for faster execution
- Process integration with WebAssembly proposals (GC, EH, Threading) and mathematical operation optimization with Greek symbols
- Handle custom optimization passes for Runa-specific patterns and deoptimization-aware optimization for speculative execution
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system and host function call optimization
- Handle table and indirect call optimization and memory layout optimization for better cache performance

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- wasm_optimizer enables comprehensive WebAssembly optimization and AOTT runtime compilation optimization
- Proper WebAssembly optimization ensures correct stack machine optimization and SIMD vectorization
- wasm_optimizer support enables Runa runtime for advanced WebAssembly optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- WebAssembly-specific peephole optimizations and stack machine optimization and local variable promotion
