Note:
This file implements advanced register allocation for MIPS AOTT code generation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process graph coloring register allocation with spilling and linear scan register allocation for fast compilation
- Handle SSA-based register allocation with phi resolution and profile-guided register allocation decisions
- Manage integration with MIPS register architecture and caller/callee-saved register management
- Process register pressure analysis and optimization with spill code generation and optimization
- Handle register coalescing and move elimination with integration with AOTT tier system for allocation strategies
- Process support for vector registers and register allocation for mathematical Greek symbols
- Handle MIPS-specific register allocation optimizations and register file management
- Process integration with instruction selection and code generation for optimal register usage

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- register_allocator enables comprehensive MIPS register allocation and optimization for AOTT code generation
- Proper register allocation ensures correct MIPS register architecture utilization and spill code generation
- register_allocator support enables Runa runtime for advanced MIPS register allocation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Graph coloring register allocation with spilling and linear scan register allocation for fast compilation
- SSA-based register allocation with phi resolution and profile-guided register allocation decisions
- Integration with MIPS register architecture and caller/callee-saved register management
- Register pressure analysis and optimization with spill code generation and optimization
- Register coalescing and move elimination with integration with AOTT tier system for allocation strategies
- Support for vector registers and register allocation for mathematical Greek symbols
- MIPS-specific register allocation optimizations and register file management
- Integration with instruction selection and code generation for optimal register usage
