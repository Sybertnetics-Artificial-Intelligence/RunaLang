This file implements peephole optimization for x86-64 AOTT code generation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process local instruction-level optimizations and pattern matching for x86-64 instruction sequences
- Handle strength reduction optimization and constant folding with x86-64-specific optimizations
- Manage instruction combining and redundant instruction elimination with peephole pattern recognition
- Process integration with AOTT tier system for optimization strategies and profile-guided peephole optimization
- Handle x86-64 instruction encoding optimization and addressing mode optimization
- Process mathematical operation optimization with Greek symbols and x86-64 instruction fusion
- Handle integration with register allocation and instruction selection for optimal peephole optimization
- Process x86-64-specific peephole patterns and instruction sequence optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- peephole_optimizer enables comprehensive x86-64 peephole optimization and instruction-level optimization for AOTT code generation
- Proper peephole optimization ensures correct x86-64 instruction sequence optimization and strength reduction
- peephole_optimizer support enables Runa runtime for advanced x86-64 peephole optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Local instruction-level optimizations and pattern matching for x86-64 instruction sequences
