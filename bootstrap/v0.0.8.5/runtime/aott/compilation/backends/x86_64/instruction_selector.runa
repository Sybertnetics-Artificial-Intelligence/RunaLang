Note:
This file implements advanced instruction selection for x86-64 AOTT code generation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process pattern matching for optimal x86-64 instruction selection with cost-based instruction selection and multiple alternatives
- Handle integration with SSE/AVX/AVX-512 vector instructions and complex addressing mode utilization
- Manage profile-guided instruction selection decisions with instruction fusion and macro-operation optimization
- Process integration with AOTT tier system for selection strategies and mathematical operation optimization with Greek symbols
- Handle x86-64-specific instruction pattern matching and addressing mode optimization
- Process integration with register allocation for optimal instruction forms and instruction latency and throughput optimization
- Handle support for both natural and technical syntax optimization and x86-64 instruction encoding optimization
- Process ModR/M and SIB byte optimization and x86-64 instruction prefix optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- instruction_selector enables comprehensive x86-64 instruction selection and optimization for AOTT code generation
- Proper instruction selection ensures correct pattern matching and cost-based optimization for x86-64 cores
- instruction_selector support enables Runa runtime for advanced x86-64 instruction selection workflows
