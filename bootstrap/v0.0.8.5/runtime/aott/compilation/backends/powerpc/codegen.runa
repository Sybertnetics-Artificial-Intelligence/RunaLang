Note:
This file implements direct PowerPC code generation for AOTT runtime compilation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process direct PowerPC machine code generation without LLVM dependency with PowerPC instruction set architecture support
- Handle PowerPC vectorization capabilities and efficient register allocation and instruction scheduling
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for progressive optimization and profile-guided code generation with speculation support
- Process deoptimization metadata generation and guard insertion with exception handling and stack unwinding support
- Handle memory management and executable code allocation with performance instrumentation and profiling hooks
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- Handle PowerPC-specific optimizations and instruction encoding with addressing mode optimization
- Process integration with PowerPC calling conventions and ABI compliance

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- codegen enables comprehensive PowerPC native code generation and AOTT runtime compilation
- Proper PowerPC code generation ensures correct instruction set architecture support and vectorization
- codegen support enables Runa runtime for advanced PowerPC compilation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Direct machine code generation without LLVM dependency with PowerPC instruction set architecture support
- PowerPC vectorization capabilities with efficient register allocation and instruction scheduling
- Integration with AOTT tier system for progressive optimization and profile-guided code generation with speculation support
- Deoptimization metadata generation and guard insertion with exception handling and stack unwinding support
- Memory management and executable code allocation with performance instrumentation and profiling hooks
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- PowerPC-specific optimizations and instruction encoding with addressing mode optimization
- Integration with PowerPC calling conventions and ABI compliance
