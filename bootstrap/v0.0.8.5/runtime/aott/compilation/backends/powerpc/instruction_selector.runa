This file implements advanced instruction selection for PowerPC AOTT code generation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process pattern matching for optimal PowerPC instruction selection with cost-based instruction selection and multiple alternatives
- Handle integration with PowerPC vector instructions and complex addressing mode utilization
- Manage profile-guided instruction selection decisions with instruction fusion and macro-operation optimization
- Process integration with AOTT tier system for selection strategies and mathematical operation optimization with Greek symbols
- Handle PowerPC-specific instruction pattern matching and addressing mode optimization
- Process integration with register allocation for optimal instruction forms and instruction latency and throughput optimization
- Handle support for both natural and technical syntax optimization and PowerPC instruction encoding optimization
- Process PowerPC extension support and conditional execution instruction selection

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- instruction_selector enables comprehensive PowerPC instruction selection and optimization for AOTT code generation
- Proper instruction selection ensures correct pattern matching and cost-based optimization for PowerPC cores
- instruction_selector support enables Runa runtime for advanced PowerPC instruction selection workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Pattern matching for optimal PowerPC instruction selection with cost-based instruction selection and multiple alternatives
