Note:
This file implements OpenCL backend for GPU AOTT runtime compilation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process OpenCL kernel generation from Runa bytecode with OpenCL C code generation
- Handle GPU memory management and OpenCL work group optimization with device-specific optimization
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for GPU optimization strategies and profile-guided GPU optimization
- Process OpenCL kernel optimization and GPU register allocation with local memory optimization
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- Process OpenCL debugging support and GPU performance monitoring with OpenCL-specific optimizations
- Handle OpenCL target architecture support and OpenCL optimization level management
- Process integration with OpenCL runtime and GPU host environment coordination

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- opencl_backend enables comprehensive OpenCL kernel generation and GPU AOTT runtime compilation
- Proper OpenCL backend ensures correct OpenCL C code generation and GPU memory management
- opencl_backend support enables Runa runtime for advanced cross-platform GPU compilation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- OpenCL kernel generation from Runa bytecode with OpenCL C code generation
- GPU memory management and OpenCL work group optimization with device-specific optimization
- Integration with AOTT tier system for GPU optimization strategies and profile-guided GPU optimization
- OpenCL kernel optimization and GPU register allocation with local memory optimization
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- OpenCL debugging support and GPU performance monitoring with OpenCL-specific optimizations
- OpenCL target architecture support and OpenCL optimization level management
- Integration with OpenCL runtime and GPU host environment coordination
