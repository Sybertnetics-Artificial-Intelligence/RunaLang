Note:
This file implements CUDA backend for GPU AOTT runtime compilation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process CUDA kernel generation from Runa bytecode with CUDA PTX assembly generation
- Handle GPU memory management and CUDA thread block optimization with warp-level optimization
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for GPU optimization strategies and profile-guided GPU optimization
- Process CUDA kernel optimization and GPU register allocation with shared memory optimization
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- Process CUDA debugging support and GPU performance monitoring with CUDA-specific optimizations
- Handle CUDA target architecture support and CUDA optimization level management
- Process integration with CUDA runtime and GPU host environment coordination

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- cuda_backend enables comprehensive CUDA kernel generation and GPU AOTT runtime compilation
- Proper CUDA backend ensures correct PTX assembly generation and GPU memory management
- cuda_backend support enables Runa runtime for advanced GPU compilation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
