Note:
This file implements DSP backend for digital signal processing AOTT runtime compilation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process DSP kernel generation from Runa bytecode with DSP-specific instruction generation
- Handle DSP memory management and DSP pipeline optimization with real-time processing optimization
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for DSP optimization strategies and profile-guided DSP optimization
- Process DSP kernel optimization and DSP register allocation with specialized DSP instruction optimization
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- Process DSP debugging support and DSP performance monitoring with DSP-specific optimizations
- Handle DSP target architecture support and DSP optimization level management
- Process integration with DSP runtime and DSP host environment coordination

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- dsp_backend enables comprehensive DSP kernel generation and digital signal processing AOTT runtime compilation
- Proper DSP backend ensures correct DSP instruction generation and DSP memory management
- dsp_backend support enables Runa runtime for advanced digital signal processing compilation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- DSP kernel generation from Runa bytecode with DSP-specific instruction generation
