Note:
This file implements advanced instruction selection for AArch64 AOTT code generation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process pattern matching for optimal AArch64 instruction selection with cost-based instruction selection and multiple alternatives
- Handle integration with NEON/Advanced SIMD vector instructions and integration with SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) instructions
- Manage profile-guided instruction selection decisions with complex addressing mode utilization including pre/post-indexing
- Process instruction fusion and macro-operation optimization with integration with AOTT tier system for selection strategies
- Handle mathematical operation optimization with Greek symbols and branch prediction and conditional instruction optimization
- Process integration with register allocation for optimal instruction forms and instruction latency and throughput optimization for ARM cores
- Handle support for both natural and technical syntax optimization with ARMv8-A specific instruction pattern matching
- Process conditional execution and predication support with load/store pair instruction optimization
- Handle barrel shifter integration for efficient operations and pointer authentication instruction selection

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- instruction_selector enables comprehensive AArch64 instruction selection and optimization for AOTT code generation
- Proper instruction selection ensures correct pattern matching and cost-based optimization for ARM cores
- instruction_selector support enables Runa runtime for advanced AArch64 instruction selection workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
