Note:
This file implements direct AArch64 code generation for AOTT runtime compilation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process direct AArch64 machine code generation without LLVM dependency with ARMv8-A instruction set architecture support
- Handle NEON vectorization capabilities and Advanced SIMD with efficient register allocation and instruction scheduling
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for progressive optimization and profile-guided code generation with speculation support
- Process deoptimization metadata generation and guard insertion with exception handling and stack unwinding support
- Handle memory management and executable code allocation with performance instrumentation and profiling hooks
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- Handle support for both AArch64 and AArch32 compatibility modes with advanced branch prediction and conditional execution
- Process Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) support for future ARM cores with pointer authentication and memory tagging support
- Handle integration with ARM TrustZone for secure execution

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- codegen enables comprehensive AArch64 native code generation and AOTT runtime compilation
- Proper AArch64 code generation ensures correct ARMv8-A instruction set architecture support and NEON vectorization
- codegen support enables Runa runtime for advanced AArch64 compilation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Direct AArch64 machine code generation without LLVM dependency with ARMv8-A instruction set architecture support
