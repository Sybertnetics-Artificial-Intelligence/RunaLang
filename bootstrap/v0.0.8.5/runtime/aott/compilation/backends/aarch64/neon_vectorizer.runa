This file implements NEON vectorization for AArch64 AOTT code generation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process NEON vector instruction generation and optimization with Advanced SIMD support
- Handle vector loop optimization and vectorization analysis with NEON instruction selection
- Manage vector register allocation and management with NEON-specific optimizations
- Process vector memory access optimization and vector data type handling
- Handle integration with AOTT tier system for vectorization strategies and profile-guided vectorization
- Process mathematical vector operations with Greek symbols and vector instruction fusion
- Handle NEON instruction scheduling and vector register pressure management
- Process integration with SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) for future ARM cores

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- neon_vectorizer enables comprehensive NEON vectorization and optimization for AArch64 AOTT code generation
- Proper NEON vectorization ensures correct Advanced SIMD utilization and vector instruction optimization
