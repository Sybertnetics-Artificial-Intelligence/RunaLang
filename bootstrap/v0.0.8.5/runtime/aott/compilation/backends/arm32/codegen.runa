Note:
This file implements direct ARM32 code generation for AOTT runtime compilation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process direct ARM32 machine code generation without LLVM dependency with ARMv7-A instruction set architecture support
- Handle ARM32 vectorization capabilities and efficient register allocation and instruction scheduling
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for progressive optimization and profile-guided code generation with speculation support
- Process deoptimization metadata generation and guard insertion with exception handling and stack unwinding support
- Handle memory management and executable code allocation with performance instrumentation and profiling hooks
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- Handle ARM32-specific optimizations and instruction encoding with addressing mode optimization
- Process integration with ARM32 calling conventions and ABI compliance

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- codegen enables comprehensive ARM32 native code generation and AOTT runtime compilation
- Proper ARM32 code generation ensures correct instruction set architecture support and vectorization
- codegen support enables Runa runtime for advanced ARM32 compilation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Direct machine code generation without LLVM dependency with ARM32 instruction set architecture support
- ARM32 vectorization capabilities with efficient register allocation and instruction scheduling
- Integration with AOTT tier system for progressive optimization and profile-guided code generation with speculation support
- Deoptimization metadata generation and guard insertion with exception handling and stack unwinding support
- Memory management and executable code allocation with performance instrumentation and profiling hooks
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization for Greek variables
- ARM32-specific optimizations and instruction encoding with addressing mode optimization
- Integration with ARM32 calling conventions and ABI compliance
