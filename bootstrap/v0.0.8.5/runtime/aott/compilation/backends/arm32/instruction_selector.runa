Note:
This file implements advanced instruction selection for ARM32 AOTT code generation in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process pattern matching for optimal ARM32 instruction selection with cost-based instruction selection and multiple alternatives
- Handle integration with ARM32 vector instructions and complex addressing mode utilization
- Manage profile-guided instruction selection decisions with instruction fusion and macro-operation optimization
- Process integration with AOTT tier system for selection strategies and mathematical operation optimization with Greek symbols
- Handle ARM32-specific instruction pattern matching and addressing mode optimization
- Process integration with register allocation for optimal instruction forms and instruction latency and throughput optimization
- Handle support for both natural and technical syntax optimization and ARM32 instruction encoding optimization
- Process ARM32 extension support and conditional execution instruction selection

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- instruction_selector enables comprehensive ARM32 instruction selection and optimization for AOTT code generation
- Proper instruction selection ensures correct pattern matching and cost-based optimization for ARM32 cores
- instruction_selector support enables Runa runtime for advanced ARM32 instruction selection workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Pattern matching for optimal ARM32 instruction selection with cost-based instruction selection and multiple alternatives
