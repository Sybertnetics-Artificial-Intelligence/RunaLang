Note:
This file handles generic specialization for AOTT runtime performance optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process automatic specialization of generic functions for concrete types
- Handle profile-guided specialization based on hot type instantiations
- Manage partial specialization for frequently used type combinations
- Process template instantiation and monomorphization optimization
- Handle code size vs. performance tradeoff analysis for specializations
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for progressive specialization
- Process specialization of generic data structures and containers
- Handle mathematical generic specialization with Greek type variables
- Manage exception handling specialization for generic error types
- Process multi-threaded specialization with thread-local type instances
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Manage incremental specialization for dynamic optimization
- Process deoptimization handling for specialized code paths
- Handle generic constraint specialization and validation
- Manage specialization cache management and optimization
- Process support for both natural and technical syntax analysis
- Handle specialization debugging and performance analysis tools
- Manage integration with devirtualization and inlining optimizations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- generic_specialization enables comprehensive generic optimization for AOTT runtime performance
- Proper generic specialization ensures maximum performance gains from generic code
- generic_specialization support enables Runa compilation for advanced generic optimization workflows
