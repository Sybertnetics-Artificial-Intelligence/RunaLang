Note:
This file handles type inference for AOTT runtime optimization and analysis.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process automatic type inference for variables and expressions
- Handle constraint-based type inference and unification
- Manage type inference for generic functions and data structures
- Process type inference for mathematical expressions with Greek variables
- Handle type inference for exception handling and error types
- Manage type inference integration with AOTT tier system
- Process profile-guided type inference for hot code paths
- Handle type inference for multi-threaded and concurrent code
- Manage type inference integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Process incremental type inference for dynamic optimization
- Handle type inference for deoptimization and reconstruction
- Manage type inference debugging and visualization tools
- Process type inference performance monitoring and analysis
- Handle type inference integration with other optimization passes
- Manage support for both natural and technical syntax analysis
- Process type inference for escape analysis and memory optimization
- Handle type inference for devirtualization and specialization
- Manage type inference for constant propagation and folding

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- type_inference enables comprehensive type analysis for AOTT runtime optimization
- Proper type inference ensures correct optimization opportunities and type safety
- type_inference support enables Runa compilation for advanced type-based optimization workflows
