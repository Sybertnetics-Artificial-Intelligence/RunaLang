This file handles devirtualization analysis for AOTT runtime performance optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process virtual call site analysis and devirtualization opportunities
- Handle class hierarchy analysis for precise type information
- Manage profile-guided devirtualization based on runtime type distribution
- Process speculative devirtualization with deoptimization support
- Handle interface call devirtualization and method resolution
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for progressive devirtualization
- Process polymorphic inline cache optimization
- Handle mathematical object method devirtualization with Greek variables
- Manage exception handling devirtualization for error method calls
- Process multi-threaded devirtualization with thread-local type information
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Manage incremental devirtualization for dynamic optimization
- Process deoptimization metadata generation for speculative optimizations
- Handle type-based method specialization and monomorphization
- Manage call site profiling and type distribution analysis
- Process support for both natural and technical syntax analysis
- Handle devirtualization debugging and performance analysis tools
- Manage integration with generic specialization and inlining

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- devirtualization enables comprehensive virtual call optimization for AOTT runtime performance
