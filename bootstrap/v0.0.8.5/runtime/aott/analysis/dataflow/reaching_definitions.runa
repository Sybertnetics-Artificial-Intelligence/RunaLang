This file handles reaching definitions analysis for AOTT runtime optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process forward dataflow analysis for reaching definitions computation
- Handle definition-use chain analysis and tracking
- Manage reaching definitions sets and union operations
- Process reaching definitions analysis for constant propagation
- Handle reaching definitions analysis for dead code elimination
- Manage reaching definitions analysis for copy propagation
- Process reaching definitions analysis for common subexpression elimination
- Handle reaching definitions analysis for partial redundancy elimination
- Manage reaching definitions analysis for SSA form construction
- Process reaching definitions analysis for exception handling
- Handle integration with AOTT tier system for progressive analysis
- Manage profile-guided reaching definitions analysis
- Process mathematical definition reaching analysis with Greek symbols
- Handle multi-threaded reaching definitions analysis
- Manage support for both natural and technical syntax analysis
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Handle incremental reaching definitions analysis for dynamic optimization
- Manage reaching definitions analysis for deoptimization support

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- reaching_definitions enables comprehensive definition tracking for AOTT runtime optimization
- Proper reaching definitions analysis ensures correct optimization opportunities and data flow analysis
- reaching_definitions support enables Runa compilation for advanced definition-based optimization workflows
