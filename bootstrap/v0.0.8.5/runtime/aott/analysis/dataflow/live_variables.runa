This file performs the following tasks:
- Process backward dataflow analysis for live variable detection
- Handle live variable computation using worklist algorithms
- Manage live variable sets and intersection operations
- Process live variable analysis for register allocation
- Handle live variable analysis for dead code elimination
- Manage live variable analysis for memory optimization
- Process live variable analysis for instruction scheduling
- Handle live variable analysis for spill code generation
- Manage live variable analysis for SSA form integration
- Process live variable analysis for exception handling
- Handle integration with AOTT tier system for progressive analysis
- Manage profile-guided live variable analysis
