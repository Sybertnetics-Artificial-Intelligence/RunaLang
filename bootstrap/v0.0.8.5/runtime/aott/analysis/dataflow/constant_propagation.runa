This file handles constant propagation analysis for AOTT runtime optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process forward dataflow analysis for constant value propagation
- Handle interprocedural constant propagation across function boundaries
- Manage conditional constant propagation with branch analysis
- Process constant folding opportunity identification and application
- Handle mathematical constant propagation with Greek symbols
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for progressive optimization
- Process profile-guided constant propagation for hot code paths
- Handle sparse constant propagation using SSA form integration
- Manage exception handling impact on constant propagation
