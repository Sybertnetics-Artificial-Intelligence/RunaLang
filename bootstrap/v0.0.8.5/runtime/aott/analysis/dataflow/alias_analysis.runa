This file handles alias analysis for AOTT runtime memory optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process points-to analysis for pointer and reference tracking
- Handle flow-sensitive and flow-insensitive alias analysis
- Manage context-sensitive interprocedural alias analysis
- Process memory disambiguation for optimization opportunities
- Handle heap object tracking and lifetime analysis
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for progressive precision
- Process profile-guided alias analysis for hot memory operations
- Handle mathematical pointer analysis with Greek variable tracking
- Manage exception handling impact on pointer aliasing
- Process multi-threaded alias analysis with synchronization awareness
- Handle support for both natural and technical syntax analysis
- Manage integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Process incremental alias analysis for dynamic optimization
- Handle field-sensitive analysis for structured data types
- Manage array element aliasing and bounds analysis
- Process integration with escape analysis and memory management
- Handle deoptimization-safe alias tracking
- Manage memory safety verification through alias analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- alias_analysis enables comprehensive memory optimization for AOTT runtime performance
- Proper alias analysis ensures correct memory disambiguation and optimization opportunities
