Note:
This file handles execution counter management for AOTT runtime performance monitoring.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process execution counter initialization and configuration
- Handle execution counter increment and decrement operations
- Manage execution counter threshold detection and triggering
- Process execution counter statistics collection and analysis
- Handle execution counter integration with hot path detection
- Manage execution counter integration with AOTT tier system
- Process execution counter profile data collection
- Handle execution counter mathematical operations with Greek variables
- Manage execution counter exception handling and recovery
- Process execution counter multi-threaded synchronization
- Handle execution counter integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Manage execution counter incremental updates and optimization
- Process execution counter deoptimization and reset handling
- Handle execution counter debugging and visualization tools
- Manage execution counter performance monitoring and analysis
- Process execution counter integration with optimization decisions
- Handle support for both natural and technical syntax
- Manage execution counter adaptive threshold management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- execution_counter enables comprehensive execution monitoring for AOTT runtime performance
- Proper execution counting ensures accurate hot path detection and optimization decisions
