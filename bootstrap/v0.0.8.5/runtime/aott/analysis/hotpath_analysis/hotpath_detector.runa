This file handles hot path detection for AOTT runtime optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process dynamic hot path identification based on execution frequency
- Handle static hot path prediction using heuristics and analysis
- Manage multi-tier hot path classification for AOTT optimization levels
- Process profile-guided hot path detection with statistical analysis
- Handle call graph hot path traversal and identification
- Manage loop-based hot path detection for iterative computations
- Process branch frequency analysis for conditional hot paths
- Handle integration with execution counters for real-time detection
- Manage mathematical computation hot path detection with Greek variables
- Process exception handling hot path analysis
- Handle multi-threaded hot path detection across thread boundaries
- Manage integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Process incremental hot path detection for dynamic optimization
- Handle deoptimization trigger detection for cold path transitions
- Manage memory access hot path analysis
