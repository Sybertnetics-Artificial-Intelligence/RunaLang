Note:
This file handles call graph construction and building for AOTT runtime optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process call graph construction from program analysis
- Handle function call site identification and mapping
- Manage call graph node creation and edge establishment
- Process indirect call resolution and virtual method handling
- Handle call graph refinement and optimization
- Manage call graph validation and consistency checking
- Process call graph serialization and persistence
- Handle call graph merging and incremental updates
- Manage call graph statistics and metrics collection
- Process call graph visualization and debugging support
- Handle integration with AOTT tier system for progressive building
- Manage profile-guided call graph enhancement
- Process mathematical function call graph construction with Greek symbols
- Handle exception handling call graph integration
- Manage multi-threaded call graph construction
- Process support for both natural and technical syntax analysis
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Manage call graph evolution tracking for adaptive optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- builder enables comprehensive call graph construction for AOTT runtime optimization
