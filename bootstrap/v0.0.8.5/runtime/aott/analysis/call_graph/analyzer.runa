This file handles call graph analysis for AOTT runtime optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process call graph traversal algorithms and pattern detection
- Handle strongly connected component detection for recursion analysis
- Manage critical path analysis for performance optimization
- Process function reachability analysis and dead code detection
- Handle call frequency analysis and hot path identification
- Manage inline expansion cost-benefit analysis
- Process function clustering analysis for locality optimization
- Handle call graph slicing for focused analysis
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for tiered analysis
- Process profile-guided analysis refinement and accuracy improvement
- Handle mathematical function call pattern analysis with Greek symbols
- Manage cross-procedural dependency analysis
- Process exception propagation analysis through call chains
- Handle support for both natural and technical syntax analysis
