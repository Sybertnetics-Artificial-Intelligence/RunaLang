This file handles escape analysis detection for AOTT runtime memory optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process object escape detection through method boundaries
- Handle context-sensitive escape analysis for precise results
- Manage inter-procedural escape analysis across call graphs
- Process field-sensitive escape analysis for structured objects
- Handle thread escape analysis for concurrent object access
- Manage integration with AOTT tier system for progressive precision
- Process profile-guided escape analysis for hot allocation sites
- Handle mathematical object tracking with Greek variable handling
- Manage exception handling impact on object escape behavior
- Process stack allocation candidate identification
- Handle scalar replacement opportunity detection
- Manage integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Process incremental escape analysis for dynamic optimization
- Handle deoptimization-safe escape tracking
- Manage memory safety verification through escape analysis
- Process integration with garbage collector and memory management
- Handle support for both natural and technical syntax analysis
- Manage escape analysis visualization and debugging tools

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- escape_detector enables comprehensive memory optimization for AOTT runtime performance
