Note:
This file handles stack allocation optimization for AOTT runtime memory management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process stack allocation candidate identification and analysis
- Handle stack allocation safety verification and validation
- Manage stack allocation size and alignment optimization
- Process stack allocation lifetime management and cleanup
- Handle stack allocation integration with escape analysis
- Manage stack allocation integration with garbage collection
- Process stack allocation for exception handling contexts
- Handle stack allocation for multi-threaded environments
- Manage stack allocation integration with AOTT tier system
- Process profile-guided stack allocation optimization
- Handle mathematical object stack allocation with Greek variables
- Manage stack allocation integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Process incremental stack allocation optimization
- Handle stack allocation deoptimization and reconstruction
- Manage stack allocation memory layout optimization
- Process stack allocation integration with constant propagation
- Handle support for both natural and technical syntax
- Manage stack allocation debugging and visualization tools

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- stack_allocation enables comprehensive memory optimization for AOTT runtime performance
- Proper stack allocation ensures maximum memory efficiency and reduced garbage collection pressure
- stack_allocation support enables Runa compilation for advanced memory optimization workflows
