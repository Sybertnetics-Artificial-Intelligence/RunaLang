This file handles scalar replacement optimization for AOTT runtime performance enhancement.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process object-to-scalar decomposition for non-escaping objects
- Handle field-by-field replacement with individual variables
- Manage aggregate object elimination through scalar promotion
- Process integration with escape analysis for replacement decisions
- Handle SSA form integration for scalar variable management
- Manage multi-tier scalar replacement strategies for AOTT tiers
- Process profile-guided scalar replacement for hot object accesses
- Handle mathematical object scalar replacement with Greek variables
- Manage exception handling for replaced scalar variables
- Process concurrent scalar replacement in multi-threaded contexts
- Handle integration with register allocation for scalar variables
- Manage dead field elimination and unused member removal
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system
- Handle incremental scalar replacement optimization
- Manage deoptimization handling for replaced objects
- Process memory layout optimization through scalar packing
- Handle integration with constant propagation for scalar values
- Manage support for both natural and technical syntax

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- scalar_replacement enables comprehensive object optimization for AOTT runtime performance
- Proper scalar replacement ensures maximum memory efficiency and performance gains
