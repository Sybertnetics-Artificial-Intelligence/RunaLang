Note:
This file handles type usage and polymorphism profiling for the AOTT runtime including type stability analysis across function calls, polymorphic call site monitoring and classification, type specialization opportunity identification, interface implementation tracking, generic type instantiation profiling, type hierarchy usage analysis, dynamic type checking overhead measurement, type inference accuracy tracking, monomorphization candidate identification, type-based optimization decisions, inline cache effectiveness monitoring, type prediction and speculation success rates, memory layout optimization hints, and type-specific performance characteristics.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process type stability analysis across function calls
- Handle polymorphic call site monitoring and classification
- Manage type specialization opportunity identification
- Process interface implementation tracking
- Handle generic type instantiation profiling
- Manage type hierarchy usage analysis
- Process dynamic type checking overhead measurement
- Handle type inference accuracy tracking
- Manage monomorphization candidate identification
- Process type-based optimization decisions
- Handle inline cache effectiveness monitoring
- Manage type prediction and speculation success rates
- Process memory layout optimization hints
- Handle type-specific performance characteristics

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- type_profiler enables comprehensive type usage and polymorphism profiling for the AOTT runtime
- Proper type profiling ensures correct type specialization opportunity identification and polymorphic call site monitoring
- type_profiler support enables Runa compilation for type-based optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Type stability analysis across function calls
