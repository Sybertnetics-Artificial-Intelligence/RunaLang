Note:
This file handles execution frequency and performance profiling for the AOTT runtime including function execution frequency tracking across all tiers, hot path identification and performance measurement, tier transition monitoring and optimization, call stack profiling and depth analysis, loop iteration counting and optimization hints, exception and control flow profiling, memory access pattern tracking, cache miss and performance counter integration, profile-guided optimization data collection, adaptive threshold management for tier promotion, speculation success/failure tracking, deoptimization event recording, performance regression detection, and real-time profiling with minimal overhead.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process function execution frequency tracking across all tiers
- Handle hot path identification and performance measurement
- Manage tier transition monitoring and optimization
- Process call stack profiling and depth analysis
- Handle loop iteration counting and optimization hints
- Manage exception and control flow profiling
- Process memory access pattern tracking
- Handle cache miss and performance counter integration
- Manage profile-guided optimization data collection
- Process adaptive threshold management for tier promotion
- Handle speculation success/failure tracking
- Manage deoptimization event recording
- Process performance regression detection
- Handle real-time profiling with minimal overhead

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- execution_profiler enables comprehensive execution frequency and performance profiling for the AOTT runtime
- Proper execution profiling ensures correct hot path identification and tier transition monitoring
- execution_profiler support enables Runa compilation for execution optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Function execution frequency tracking across all tiers
