Note:
This file handles memory allocation pattern profiling for the AOTT runtime including memory allocation frequency and size tracking, object lifetime analysis and escape detection, allocation site profiling and optimization hints, garbage collection impact measurement, memory layout optimization guidance, stack vs heap allocation analysis, object pool utilization tracking, memory fragmentation detection, allocation pattern recognition, NUMA-aware allocation profiling, cache locality analysis for allocations, memory pressure monitoring, allocation-based tier promotion hints, and escape analysis validation through runtime data.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process memory allocation frequency and size tracking
- Handle object lifetime analysis and escape detection
- Manage allocation site profiling and optimization hints
- Process garbage collection impact measurement
- Handle memory layout optimization guidance
- Manage stack vs heap allocation analysis
- Process object pool utilization tracking
- Handle memory fragmentation detection
- Manage allocation pattern recognition
- Process NUMA-aware allocation profiling
- Handle cache locality analysis for allocations
- Manage memory pressure monitoring
- Process allocation-based tier promotion hints
- Handle escape analysis validation through runtime data

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- allocation_profiler enables comprehensive memory allocation pattern profiling for the AOTT runtime
- Proper allocation profiling ensures correct memory optimization and escape analysis validation
- allocation_profiler support enables Runa compilation for memory optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Memory allocation frequency and size tracking
- Object lifetime analysis and escape detection
- Allocation site profiling and optimization hints
- Garbage collection impact measurement
- Memory layout optimization guidance
- Stack vs heap allocation analysis
- Object pool utilization tracking
- Memory fragmentation detection
- Allocation pattern recognition
- NUMA-aware allocation profiling
- Cache locality analysis for allocations
- Memory pressure monitoring
- Allocation-based tier promotion hints
- Escape analysis validation through runtime data
