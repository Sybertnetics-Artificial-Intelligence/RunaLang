This file handles call site profiling, polymorphism, and devirtualization opportunities for the AOTT 5-tier execution system including call site registration and tracking, polymorphism analysis, devirtualization analysis, inline cache management, call graph construction, tier-specific analysis, adaptive profiling, performance analysis, optimization integration, data export and reporting, utility functions, query and analysis functions, advanced analytics, integration functions, real-time analysis, statistical analysis, machine learning integration, and debugging and diagnostics.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process call site profiling, polymorphism, and devirtualization opportunities
- Handle call site registration and tracking and polymorphism analysis
- Manage devirtualization analysis and inline cache management
- Process call graph construction and tier-specific analysis
- Handle adaptive profiling and performance analysis
- Manage optimization integration and data export and reporting
- Process utility functions and query and analysis functions
- Handle advanced analytics and integration functions
- Manage real-time analysis and statistical analysis
- Process machine learning integration and debugging and diagnostics

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- call_site_profiler enables comprehensive call site profiling for the AOTT 5-tier execution system
- Proper call site profiling ensures correct polymorphism analysis and devirtualization opportunities
- call_site_profiler support enables Runa compilation for call site optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Call site profiling, polymorphism, and devirtualization opportunities
- Call site registration and tracking and polymorphism analysis
- Devirtualization analysis and inline cache management
- Call graph construction and tier-specific analysis
- Adaptive profiling and performance analysis
- Optimization integration and data export and reporting
- Utility functions and query and analysis functions
