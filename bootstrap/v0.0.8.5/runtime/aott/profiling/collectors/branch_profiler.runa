Note:
This file handles branch prediction and control flow profiling for the AOTT runtime including branch prediction accuracy tracking, conditional execution pattern analysis, control flow optimization hints, branch frequency and bias measurement, indirect branch target profiling, loop branch behavior analysis, switch statement optimization guidance, exception path profiling, branch correlation analysis, speculative execution support, branch elimination opportunities, control flow graph optimization, tier-specific branch behavior, and branch-based tier promotion hints.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process branch prediction accuracy tracking and conditional execution pattern analysis
- Handle control flow optimization hints and branch frequency and bias measurement
- Manage indirect branch target profiling and loop branch behavior analysis
- Process switch statement optimization guidance and exception path profiling
- Handle branch correlation analysis and speculative execution support
- Manage branch elimination opportunities and control flow graph optimization
- Process tier-specific branch behavior and branch-based tier promotion hints

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- branch_profiler enables comprehensive branch prediction and control flow profiling for the AOTT runtime
- Proper branch profiling ensures correct control flow optimization and branch prediction accuracy tracking
- branch_profiler support enables Runa compilation for branch optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Branch prediction accuracy tracking and conditional execution pattern analysis
- Control flow optimization hints and branch frequency and bias measurement
- Indirect branch target profiling and loop branch behavior analysis
- Switch statement optimization guidance and exception path profiling
- Branch correlation analysis and speculative execution support
- Branch elimination opportunities and control flow graph optimization
- Tier-specific branch behavior and branch-based tier promotion hints
