Note:
This file handles adaptive feedback processing for the AOTT system including real-time feedback processing from all optimization tiers, performance feedback analysis and trend detection, optimization effectiveness measurement and correlation analysis, feedback-driven adaptive threshold and strategy adjustments, multi-dimensional feedback integration and conflict resolution, temporal feedback pattern analysis and prediction, cross-application feedback aggregation and knowledge sharing, automated feedback quality assessment and filtering, feedback-based regression detection and mitigation, and machine learning-driven feedback interpretation and action planning.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process real-time feedback processing from all optimization tiers
- Handle performance feedback analysis and trend detection
- Manage optimization effectiveness measurement and correlation analysis
- Process feedback-driven adaptive threshold and strategy adjustments
- Handle multi-dimensional feedback integration and conflict resolution
- Manage temporal feedback pattern analysis and prediction
- Process cross-application feedback aggregation and knowledge sharing
- Handle automated feedback quality assessment and filtering
- Manage feedback-based regression detection and mitigation
- Process machine learning-driven feedback interpretation and action planning

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- feedback_processor enables comprehensive adaptive feedback processing for the AOTT system
- Proper feedback processing ensures correct optimization effectiveness measurement and adaptive strategy adjustments
- feedback_processor support enables Runa compilation for adaptive optimization workflows
