Note:
This file handles adaptive optimization strategy selection for the AOTT system including dynamic optimization strategy selection based on workload characteristics, machine learning-based strategy recommendation and ranking, multi-tier optimization strategy coordination and sequencing, contextual strategy adaptation for different code patterns, performance-driven strategy evolution and refinement, resource-aware strategy selection for constrained environments, workload classification and strategy specialization, real-time strategy effectiveness monitoring and adjustment, cross-function strategy consistency and optimization, and predictive strategy selection using execution forecasting.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process dynamic optimization strategy selection based on workload characteristics
- Handle machine learning-based strategy recommendation and ranking
- Manage multi-tier optimization strategy coordination and sequencing
- Process contextual strategy adaptation for different code patterns
- Handle performance-driven strategy evolution and refinement
- Manage resource-aware strategy selection for constrained environments
- Process workload classification and strategy specialization
- Handle real-time strategy effectiveness monitoring and adjustment
- Manage cross-function strategy consistency and optimization
- Process predictive strategy selection using execution forecasting

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- strategy_selector enables comprehensive adaptive optimization strategy selection for the AOTT system
- Proper strategy selection ensures correct workload-based optimization and performance-driven strategy evolution
- strategy_selector support enables Runa compilation for adaptive optimization strategy workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Dynamic optimization strategy selection based on workload characteristics
- Machine learning-based strategy recommendation and ranking
- Multi-tier optimization strategy coordination and sequencing
- Contextual strategy adaptation for different code patterns
- Performance-driven strategy evolution and refinement
- Resource-aware strategy selection for constrained environments
- Workload classification and strategy specialization
- Real-time strategy effectiveness monitoring and adjustment
- Cross-function strategy consistency and optimization
- Predictive strategy selection using execution forecasting
