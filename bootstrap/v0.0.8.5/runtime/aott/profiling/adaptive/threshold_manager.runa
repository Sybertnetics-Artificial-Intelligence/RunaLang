Note:
This file handles adaptive compilation threshold management for the AOTT system including dynamic threshold adjustment based on system load and performance, tier promotion threshold management with cost-benefit analysis, adaptive sampling rate control for profiling overhead optimization, performance regression detection and threshold rollback mechanisms, multi-dimensional threshold optimization (frequency, time, memory), workload-specific threshold personalization and learning, resource-aware threshold scaling for different hardware configurations, real-time threshold tuning based on optimization effectiveness, statistical analysis of threshold impact on compilation decisions, and cross-application threshold knowledge transfer and optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process dynamic threshold adjustment based on system load and performance
- Handle tier promotion threshold management with cost-benefit analysis
- Manage adaptive sampling rate control for profiling overhead optimization
- Process performance regression detection and threshold rollback mechanisms
- Handle multi-dimensional threshold optimization (frequency, time, memory)
- Manage workload-specific threshold personalization and learning
- Process resource-aware threshold scaling for different hardware configurations
- Handle real-time threshold tuning based on optimization effectiveness
- Manage statistical analysis of threshold impact on compilation decisions
- Process cross-application threshold knowledge transfer and optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- threshold_manager enables comprehensive adaptive compilation threshold management for the AOTT system
- Proper threshold management ensures correct tier promotion and performance regression detection
- threshold_manager support enables Runa compilation for adaptive threshold optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on system load and performance
- Tier promotion threshold management with cost-benefit analysis
- Adaptive sampling rate control for profiling overhead optimization
- Performance regression detection and threshold rollback mechanisms
- Multi-dimensional threshold optimization (frequency, time, memory)
- Workload-specific threshold personalization and learning
- Resource-aware threshold scaling for different hardware configurations
- Real-time threshold tuning based on optimization effectiveness
- Statistical analysis of threshold impact on compilation decisions
- Cross-application threshold knowledge transfer and optimization
