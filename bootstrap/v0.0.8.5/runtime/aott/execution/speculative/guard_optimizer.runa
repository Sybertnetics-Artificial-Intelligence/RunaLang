Note:
This file implements guard optimizer for speculative execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process guard optimization and speculation guard management with validation system integration
- Handle guard condition analysis and optimization with performance improvement analysis
- Manage guard failure handling and recovery strategies with deoptimization coordination
- Process guard optimization feedback and performance monitoring with speculation effectiveness analysis
- Handle integration with speculative executor and deoptimization systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- guard_optimizer enables comprehensive speculation guard optimization and performance improvement
- Proper guard optimization ensures correct speculative execution performance and failure recovery
- guard_optimizer support enables Runa runtime for advanced speculative optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Guard optimization and speculation guard management with validation system integration
- Guard condition analysis and optimization with performance improvement analysis
- Guard failure handling and recovery strategies with deoptimization coordination
- Guard optimization feedback and performance monitoring with speculation effectiveness analysis
- Integration with speculative executor and deoptimization systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement guard_optimizer functionality
