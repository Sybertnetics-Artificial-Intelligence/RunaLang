Note:
This file implements value speculation system for speculative value prediction and optimization in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process value speculation and prediction with speculative value analysis and optimization
- Handle value prediction models and speculation management with performance monitoring
- Manage value speculation validation and failure handling with deoptimization coordination
- Process value speculation feedback and performance analysis with speculation effectiveness evaluation
- Handle integration with speculative executor and type speculation systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- value_speculation enables comprehensive value prediction and speculative optimization
- Proper value speculation ensures correct value-based optimization and speculation performance
- value_speculation support enables Runa runtime for advanced value speculation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Value speculation and prediction with speculative value analysis and optimization
- Value prediction models and speculation management with performance monitoring
- Value speculation validation and failure handling with deoptimization coordination
- Value speculation feedback and performance analysis with speculation effectiveness evaluation
- Integration with speculative executor and type speculation systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement value_speculation functionality
