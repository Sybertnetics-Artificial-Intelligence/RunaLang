Note:
This file implements type speculation system for advanced type prediction and monomorphic optimization in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process type prediction and monomorphic optimization through speculation with type observation system
- Handle type stability analysis and prediction model management with speculation integration
- Manage type guard system and speculation statistics with performance monitoring
- Process type speculation feedback and optimization analysis with speculation effectiveness evaluation
- Handle integration with speculative executor and polymorphic inline systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- type_speculation enables comprehensive type prediction and monomorphic optimization through speculation
- Proper type speculation ensures correct type-based optimization and speculation performance
- type_speculation support enables Runa runtime for advanced type speculation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Type prediction and monomorphic optimization through speculation with type observation system
- Type stability analysis and prediction model management with speculation integration
- Type guard system and speculation statistics with performance monitoring
- Type speculation feedback and optimization analysis with speculation effectiveness evaluation
- Integration with speculative executor and polymorphic inline systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement type_speculation functionality
