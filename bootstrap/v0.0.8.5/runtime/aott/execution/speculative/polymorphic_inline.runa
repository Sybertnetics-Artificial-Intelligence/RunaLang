Note:
This file implements polymorphic inline caching for speculative execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process polymorphic inline caching with speculation-based method call optimization and performance enhancement
- Handle polymorphic cache management and state transitions with speculation integration
- Manage polymorphic inline optimization and performance monitoring with speculation feedback
- Process polymorphic inline feedback and performance improvement analysis with speculation effectiveness
- Handle integration with speculative executor and type speculation systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- polymorphic_inline enables comprehensive polymorphic inline caching and speculative optimization
- Proper polymorphic inline caching ensures correct method call optimization and speculation performance
- polymorphic_inline support enables Runa runtime for advanced polymorphic optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Polymorphic inline caching with speculation-based method call optimization and performance enhancement
- Polymorphic cache management and state transitions with speculation integration
- Polymorphic inline optimization and performance monitoring with speculation feedback
- Polymorphic inline feedback and performance improvement analysis with speculation effectiveness
- Integration with speculative executor and type speculation systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement polymorphic_inline functionality
