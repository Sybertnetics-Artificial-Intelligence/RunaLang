Note:
This file implements speculation budget management for speculative execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process speculation budget allocation and management with resource constraint enforcement
- Handle speculation cost analysis and budget optimization with performance monitoring
- Manage speculation budget tracking and allocation strategies with adaptive optimization
- Process speculation budget feedback and performance analysis with resource utilization optimization
- Handle integration with speculative executor and resource management systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- speculation_budget enables comprehensive speculation resource management and optimization
- Proper speculation budget management ensures correct resource utilization and speculation effectiveness
- speculation_budget support enables Runa runtime for advanced speculation resource workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Speculation budget allocation and management with resource constraint enforcement
- Speculation cost analysis and budget optimization with performance monitoring
- Speculation budget tracking and allocation strategies with adaptive optimization
- Speculation budget feedback and performance analysis with resource utilization optimization
- Integration with speculative executor and resource management systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement speculation_budget functionality
