Note:
This file implements speculative execution engine for maximum performance through aggressive speculation in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process speculative execution coordination and speculation management with risk assessment
- Handle speculation execution engine and guard validation system with performance monitoring
- Manage speculation failure handling and deoptimization coordination with recovery strategies
- Process speculation performance monitoring and optimization feedback with effectiveness analysis
- Handle integration with deoptimization systems and optimization feedback loops

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- speculative_executor enables comprehensive speculative execution and maximum performance optimization
- Proper speculative execution ensures correct performance maximization and speculation failure recovery
- speculative_executor support enables Runa runtime for advanced speculative execution workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Speculative execution coordination and speculation management with risk assessment
- Speculation execution engine and guard validation system with performance monitoring
- Speculation failure handling and deoptimization coordination with recovery strategies
- Speculation performance monitoring and optimization feedback with effectiveness analysis
- Integration with deoptimization systems and optimization feedback loops
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement speculative_executor functionality
