Note:
This file implements loop specialization for speculative execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process loop specialization with speculation-based optimization and performance enhancement
- Handle loop specialization analysis and optimization decision making with cost-benefit evaluation
- Manage loop specialization implementation and performance monitoring with optimization feedback
- Process loop specialization feedback and performance improvement analysis with speculation integration
- Handle integration with speculative executor and optimization systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- loop_specialization enables comprehensive loop specialization and speculative optimization
- Proper loop specialization ensures correct performance enhancement and speculation effectiveness
- loop_specialization support enables Runa runtime for advanced loop specialization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Loop specialization with speculation-based optimization and performance enhancement
- Loop specialization analysis and optimization decision making with cost-benefit evaluation
- Loop specialization implementation and performance monitoring with optimization feedback
- Loop specialization feedback and performance improvement analysis with speculation integration
- Integration with speculative executor and optimization systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement loop_specialization functionality
