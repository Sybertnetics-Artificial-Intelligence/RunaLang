Note:
This file implements profiling hooks for bytecode execution monitoring and optimization feedback in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process execution profiling hooks for instruction counting and performance monitoring
- Handle function call profiling and execution time tracking with optimization feedback
- Manage profiling data collection and analysis for tier promotion decisions
- Process performance counter integration and statistical analysis
- Handle integration with bytecode executor and optimization systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- profiling_hooks enables comprehensive execution profiling and optimization feedback collection
- Proper profiling ensures correct performance analysis and tier promotion decisions
- profiling_hooks support enables Runa runtime for advanced performance monitoring workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Execution profiling hooks for instruction counting and performance monitoring
- Function call profiling and execution time tracking with optimization feedback
- Profiling data collection and analysis for tier promotion decisions
- Performance counter integration and statistical analysis
- Integration with bytecode executor and optimization systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement profiling_hooks functionality
