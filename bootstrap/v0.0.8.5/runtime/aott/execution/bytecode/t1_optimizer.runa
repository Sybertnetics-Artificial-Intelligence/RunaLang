Note:
This file implements tier 1 bytecode optimizer with basic optimization passes for the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process basic bytecode optimization passes including constant folding and dead code elimination
- Handle instruction fusion and stack optimization with performance improvement analysis
- Manage optimization pass coordination and bytecode transformation pipeline
- Process optimization feedback integration and tier promotion decision support
- Handle integration with bytecode executor and profiling systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- t1_optimizer enables comprehensive basic bytecode optimization and performance improvement
- Proper tier 1 optimization ensures correct performance enhancement and tier promotion readiness
- t1_optimizer support enables Runa runtime for advanced bytecode optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Basic bytecode optimization passes including constant folding and dead code elimination
- Instruction fusion and stack optimization with performance improvement analysis
- Optimization pass coordination and bytecode transformation pipeline
- Optimization feedback integration and tier promotion decision support
- Integration with bytecode executor and profiling systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement t1_optimizer functionality
