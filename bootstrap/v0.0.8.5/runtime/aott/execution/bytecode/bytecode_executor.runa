Note:
This file implements smart bytecode execution engine with enhanced dispatch and basic optimizations for the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process smart bytecode execution with enhanced dispatch system and basic optimization pipeline
- Handle instruction handlers and stack machine management with memory allocation tracking
- Manage optimized dispatch system with branch prediction and instruction prefetching
- Process bytecode profiling integration and execution statistics collection
- Handle integration with lightning tier promotion and optimization feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- bytecode_executor enables comprehensive tier 1 bytecode execution with performance optimization
- Proper bytecode execution ensures correct AOTT tier progression and performance monitoring
- bytecode_executor support enables Runa runtime for advanced tiered execution workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Smart bytecode execution with enhanced dispatch system and basic optimization pipeline
- Instruction handlers and stack machine management with memory allocation tracking
- Optimized dispatch system with branch prediction and instruction prefetching
- Bytecode profiling integration and execution statistics collection
- Integration with lightning tier promotion and optimization feedback
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement bytecode_executor functionality
