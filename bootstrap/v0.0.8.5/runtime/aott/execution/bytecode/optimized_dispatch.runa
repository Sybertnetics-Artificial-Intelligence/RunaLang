Note:
This file implements optimized dispatch system for bytecode instruction execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process optimized instruction dispatch with branch prediction and instruction prefetching
- Handle dispatch table management and handler address optimization with performance tracking
- Manage dispatch metadata collection and prediction accuracy analysis
- Process instruction dispatch frequency analysis and optimization feedback
- Handle integration with bytecode executor and profiling systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- optimized_dispatch enables comprehensive instruction dispatch optimization and performance improvement
- Proper dispatch optimization ensures correct bytecode execution performance and tier promotion
- optimized_dispatch support enables Runa runtime for advanced instruction execution workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Optimized instruction dispatch with branch prediction and instruction prefetching
- Dispatch table management and handler address optimization with performance tracking
- Dispatch metadata collection and prediction accuracy analysis
- Instruction dispatch frequency analysis and optimization feedback
- Integration with bytecode executor and profiling systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement optimized_dispatch functionality
