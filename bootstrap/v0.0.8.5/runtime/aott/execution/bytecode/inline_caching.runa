Note:
This file implements simple inline caching system for method calls and property access in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process inline cache management for method calls, property access, type checks, and field access
- Handle cache state transitions from uninitialized to monomorphic, polymorphic, and megamorphic
- Manage cache eviction strategies and invalidation policies with performance optimization
- Process cache lookup and update operations with hit rate optimization
- Handle integration with bytecode executor and promotion detection systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- inline_caching enables comprehensive method call and property access optimization
- Proper inline caching ensures correct performance optimization and tier promotion decisions
- inline_caching support enables Runa runtime for advanced caching and optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Inline cache management for method calls, property access, type checks, and field access
- Cache state transitions from uninitialized to monomorphic, polymorphic, and megamorphic
- Cache eviction strategies and invalidation policies with performance optimization
- Cache lookup and update operations with hit rate optimization
- Integration with bytecode executor and promotion detection systems

Note: TODO - Implement inline_caching functionality
