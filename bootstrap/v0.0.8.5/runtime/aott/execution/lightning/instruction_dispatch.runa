Note:
This file implements high-performance instruction dispatch system for the lightning tier in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process high-performance instruction dispatch with minimal overhead and optimized execution paths
- Handle instruction dispatch table optimization and handler address caching
- Manage dispatch performance monitoring and optimization feedback collection
- Process instruction prefetching and branch prediction integration
- Handle integration with lightning interpreter and promotion detection systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- instruction_dispatch enables comprehensive high-performance instruction execution and dispatch optimization
- Proper dispatch optimization ensures correct lightning tier performance and native tier promotion
- instruction_dispatch support enables Runa runtime for advanced high-performance execution workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- High-performance instruction dispatch with minimal overhead and optimized execution paths
- Instruction dispatch table optimization and handler address caching
- Dispatch performance monitoring and optimization feedback collection
- Instruction prefetching and branch prediction integration
- Integration with lightning interpreter and promotion detection systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement instruction_dispatch functionality
