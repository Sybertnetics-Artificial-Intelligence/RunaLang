Note:
This file implements zero-cost profiling system for lightning tier execution monitoring in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process zero-cost profiling with minimal performance overhead and efficient data collection
- Handle execution profiling and performance monitoring without impacting execution speed
- Manage profiling data aggregation and analysis for optimization decision making
- Process hardware performance counter integration and statistical analysis
- Handle integration with lightning interpreter and promotion detection systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- zero_cost_profiling enables comprehensive execution monitoring without performance degradation
- Proper zero-cost profiling ensures correct performance analysis and optimization feedback
- zero_cost_profiling support enables Runa runtime for advanced performance monitoring workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Zero-cost profiling with minimal performance overhead and efficient data collection
- Execution profiling and performance monitoring without impacting execution speed
- Profiling data aggregation and analysis for optimization decision making
- Hardware performance counter integration and statistical analysis
- Integration with lightning interpreter and promotion detection systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement zero_cost_profiling functionality
