Note:
This file implements minimal stack management system for lightning tier execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process minimal stack management with optimized memory usage and performance monitoring
- Handle stack frame management and call stack optimization with minimal overhead
- Manage stack usage tracking and peak usage analysis for performance optimization
- Process stack limit enforcement and overflow protection with safety mechanisms
- Handle integration with lightning interpreter and execution monitoring systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- minimal_stack enables comprehensive stack management optimization and memory efficiency
- Proper minimal stack handling ensures correct lightning tier performance and memory safety
- minimal_stack support enables Runa runtime for advanced stack optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Minimal stack management with optimized memory usage and performance monitoring
- Stack frame management and call stack optimization with minimal overhead
- Stack usage tracking and peak usage analysis for performance optimization
- Stack limit enforcement and overflow protection with safety mechanisms
- Integration with lightning interpreter and execution monitoring systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement minimal_stack functionality
