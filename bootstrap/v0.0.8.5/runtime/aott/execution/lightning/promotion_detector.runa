Note:
This file implements promotion detection system for lightning tier to native tier transitions in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process promotion detection analysis and tier transition decision making with performance metrics
- Handle execution frequency analysis and hot path identification for promotion candidates
- Manage promotion threshold management and adaptive threshold adjustment
- Process promotion decision coordination and tier transition execution
- Handle integration with lightning interpreter and native tier compilation systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- promotion_detector enables comprehensive tier promotion analysis and transition decision making
- Proper promotion detection ensures correct tier progression and performance optimization
- promotion_detector support enables Runa runtime for advanced tier transition workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Promotion detection analysis and tier transition decision making with performance metrics
- Execution frequency analysis and hot path identification for promotion candidates
- Promotion threshold management and adaptive threshold adjustment
- Promotion decision coordination and tier transition execution
- Integration with lightning interpreter and native tier compilation systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement promotion_detector functionality
