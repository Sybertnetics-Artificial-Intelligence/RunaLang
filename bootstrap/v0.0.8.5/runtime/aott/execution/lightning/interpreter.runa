Note:
This file implements high-performance lightning interpreter for tier 2 execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process high-performance bytecode interpretation with optimized execution engine and minimal overhead
- Handle lightning-fast instruction execution with enhanced stack machine and memory management
- Manage execution result processing and value handling with performance optimization
- Process interpreter performance monitoring and native tier promotion decision support
- Handle integration with instruction dispatch and promotion detection systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- interpreter enables comprehensive high-performance bytecode interpretation and execution optimization
- Proper lightning interpretation ensures correct tier 2 performance and native tier promotion readiness
- interpreter support enables Runa runtime for advanced high-performance interpretation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- High-performance bytecode interpretation with optimized execution engine and minimal overhead
- Lightning-fast instruction execution with enhanced stack machine and memory management
- Execution result processing and value handling with performance optimization
- Interpreter performance monitoring and native tier promotion decision support
- Integration with instruction dispatch and promotion detection systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement interpreter functionality
