Note:
This file implements native code cache management for tier 3 native execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process native code cache management with efficient storage and retrieval of compiled code artifacts
- Handle cache policy management and eviction strategy implementation with performance optimization
- Manage code memory management and memory protection with security enforcement
- Process cache validation and integrity checking with performance monitoring
- Handle integration with native executor and compilation systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- code_cache enables comprehensive native code caching and performance optimization
- Proper code caching ensures correct compilation performance and memory efficiency
- code_cache support enables Runa runtime for advanced native code management workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Native code cache management with efficient storage and retrieval of compiled code artifacts
- Cache policy management and eviction strategy implementation with performance optimization
- Code memory management and memory protection with security enforcement
- Cache validation and integrity checking with performance monitoring
- Integration with native executor and compilation systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement code_cache functionality
