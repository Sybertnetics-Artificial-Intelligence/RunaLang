Note:
This file implements basic native code optimizer for tier 3 native execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process basic native code optimization with LLVM integration and compilation pipeline management
- Handle optimization level configuration and target machine optimization settings
- Manage native code generation and optimization pass coordination
- Process optimization feedback integration and performance improvement analysis
- Handle integration with native executor and optimized tier promotion systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- basic_optimizer enables comprehensive native code optimization and performance improvement
- Proper basic optimization ensures correct native tier performance and optimized tier promotion
- basic_optimizer support enables Runa runtime for advanced native code optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Basic native code optimization with LLVM integration and compilation pipeline management
- Optimization level configuration and target machine optimization settings
- Native code generation and optimization pass coordination
- Optimization feedback integration and performance improvement analysis
- Integration with native executor and optimized tier promotion systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement basic_optimizer functionality
