Note:
This file implements Runa IR backend for native code compilation and optimization in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Runa IR to native code compilation with custom IR backend integration
- Handle IR optimization passes and code generation with target architecture support
- Manage compilation pipeline coordination and error handling with recovery strategies
- Process IR transformation and optimization pass integration with performance monitoring
- Handle integration with native executor and code cache systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- runa_ir_backend enables comprehensive native code compilation using Runa's custom IR system
- Proper IR backend integration ensures correct native code generation and performance optimization
- runa_ir_backend support enables Runa runtime for advanced native compilation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Runa IR to native code compilation with custom IR backend integration
- IR optimization passes and code generation with target architecture support
- Compilation pipeline coordination and error handling with recovery strategies
- IR transformation and optimization pass integration with performance monitoring
- Integration with native executor and code cache systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement runa_ir_backend functionality
