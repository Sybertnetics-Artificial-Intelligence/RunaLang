Note:
This file implements profile collector for native execution monitoring and optimization feedback in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process native execution profiling and performance data collection with minimal overhead
- Handle function profile collection and hot path identification for optimization decisions
- Manage performance counter integration and statistical analysis with trend detection
- Process profiling data aggregation and analysis for tier promotion and optimization feedback
- Handle integration with native executor and optimization systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- profile_collector enables comprehensive native execution profiling and optimization feedback collection
- Proper profile collection ensures correct performance analysis and optimization decision making
- profile_collector support enables Runa runtime for advanced performance monitoring workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Native execution profiling and performance data collection with minimal overhead
- Function profile collection and hot path identification for optimization decisions
- Performance counter integration and statistical analysis with trend detection
- Profiling data aggregation and analysis for tier promotion and optimization feedback
- Integration with native executor and optimization systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement profile_collector functionality
