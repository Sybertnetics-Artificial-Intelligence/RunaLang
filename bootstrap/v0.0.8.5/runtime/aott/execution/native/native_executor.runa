Note:
This file implements basic native executor for tier 3 native execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process basic native compilation and execution engine with LLVM backend integration
- Handle native function compilation and execution with performance monitoring
- Manage execution statistics collection and performance analysis with optimization feedback
- Process native code execution monitoring and health monitoring with resource utilization tracking
- Handle integration with LLVM integration and code cache systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- native_executor enables comprehensive native code execution and performance optimization
- Proper native execution ensures correct tier 3 performance and optimized tier promotion
- native_executor support enables Runa runtime for advanced native execution workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Basic native compilation and execution engine with LLVM backend integration
- Native function compilation and execution with performance monitoring
- Execution statistics collection and performance analysis with optimization feedback
- Native code execution monitoring and health monitoring with resource utilization tracking
- Integration with LLVM integration and code cache systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement native_executor functionality
