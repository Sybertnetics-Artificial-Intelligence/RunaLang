Note:
This file implements advanced vectorizer for heavily optimized native execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process advanced vectorization with SIMD code generation and vectorization analysis
- Handle data dependency analysis and memory access pattern analysis with vectorization optimization
- Manage reduction pattern detection and vectorization policies with performance optimization
- Process vectorization feedback and performance improvement analysis with optimization integration
- Handle integration with optimized native executor and SIMD instruction set systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- vectorizer enables comprehensive advanced vectorization and SIMD optimization
- Proper vectorization ensures correct performance enhancement and parallel execution optimization
- vectorizer support enables Runa runtime for advanced vectorization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Advanced vectorization with SIMD code generation and vectorization analysis
- Data dependency analysis and memory access pattern analysis with vectorization optimization
- Reduction pattern detection and vectorization policies with performance optimization
- Vectorization feedback and performance improvement analysis with optimization integration
- Integration with optimized native executor and SIMD instruction set systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement vectorizer functionality
