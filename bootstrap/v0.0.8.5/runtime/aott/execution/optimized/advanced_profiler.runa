Note:
This file implements advanced profiler for heavily optimized native execution monitoring in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process advanced execution profiling with hardware performance counters and software metrics
- Handle performance analysis and bottleneck identification with trend detection
- Manage hardware performance counter integration and statistical analysis
- Process performance monitoring and optimization feedback collection with advanced analytics
- Handle integration with optimized native executor and speculative tier promotion systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- advanced_profiler enables comprehensive advanced execution profiling and performance analysis
- Proper advanced profiling ensures correct optimization feedback and speculative tier promotion
- advanced_profiler support enables Runa runtime for advanced performance monitoring workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Advanced execution profiling with hardware performance counters and software metrics
- Performance analysis and bottleneck identification with trend detection
- Hardware performance counter integration and statistical analysis
- Performance monitoring and optimization feedback collection with advanced analytics
- Integration with optimized native executor and speculative tier promotion systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement advanced_profiler functionality
