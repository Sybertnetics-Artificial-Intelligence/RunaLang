Note:
This file implements advanced loop optimizer for heavily optimized native execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process advanced loop optimization with loop unrolling, tiling, interchange, and fusion
- Handle loop optimization passes and transformation pipeline with performance analysis
- Manage loop analysis and optimization decision making with cost-benefit evaluation
- Process loop optimization feedback and performance improvement analysis with integration
- Handle integration with optimized native executor and optimization engine systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- loop_optimizer enables comprehensive advanced loop optimization and performance improvement
- Proper loop optimization ensures correct performance enhancement and optimization effectiveness
- loop_optimizer support enables Runa runtime for advanced loop optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Advanced loop optimization with loop unrolling, tiling, interchange, and fusion
- Loop optimization passes and transformation pipeline with performance analysis
- Loop analysis and optimization decision making with cost-benefit evaluation
- Loop optimization feedback and performance improvement analysis with integration
- Integration with optimized native executor and optimization engine systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement loop_optimizer functionality
