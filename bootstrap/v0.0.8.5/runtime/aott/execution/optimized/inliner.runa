Note:
This file implements aggressive inliner for heavily optimized native execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process aggressive function inlining with call graph analysis and inlining heuristics
- Handle inlining decision making and cost-benefit analysis with performance optimization
- Manage inlining heuristics and threshold management with adaptive optimization
- Process inlining optimization and performance improvement analysis with feedback integration
- Handle integration with optimized native executor and optimization engine systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- inliner enables comprehensive aggressive function inlining and performance optimization
- Proper aggressive inlining ensures correct performance improvement and optimization effectiveness
- inliner support enables Runa runtime for advanced inlining optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Aggressive function inlining with call graph analysis and inlining heuristics
- Inlining decision making and cost-benefit analysis with performance optimization
- Inlining heuristics and threshold management with adaptive optimization
- Inlining optimization and performance improvement analysis with feedback integration
- Integration with optimized native executor and optimization engine systems
