Note:
This file implements advanced register allocator for heavily optimized native execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process advanced register allocation with graph coloring, linear scan, and optimal allocation algorithms
- Handle register allocation algorithm selection and spill strategy implementation with performance optimization
- Manage register pressure analysis and interference graph construction with allocation optimization
- Process register allocation feedback and performance improvement analysis with optimization integration
- Handle integration with optimized native executor and code generation systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- register_allocator enables comprehensive advanced register allocation and performance optimization
- Proper register allocation ensures correct code generation efficiency and execution performance
- register_allocator support enables Runa runtime for advanced register allocation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Advanced register allocation with graph coloring, linear scan, and optimal allocation algorithms
- Register allocation algorithm selection and spill strategy implementation with performance optimization
- Register pressure analysis and interference graph construction with allocation optimization
- Register allocation feedback and performance improvement analysis with optimization integration
- Integration with optimized native executor and code generation systems
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement register_allocator functionality
