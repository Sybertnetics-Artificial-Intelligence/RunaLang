Note:
This file implements heavily optimized native executor for tier 4 optimized execution in the AOTT system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process heavily optimized native execution with advanced compilation pipeline and optimization engine
- Handle inter-procedural analysis and global optimization coordination with performance monitoring
- Manage advanced vectorization and aggressive inlining with loop optimization and register allocation
- Process profile-guided recompilation and optimization feedback with performance improvement analysis
- Handle integration with speculative tier promotion and optimization systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- optimized_native enables comprehensive heavily optimized native execution and performance maximization
- Proper optimized execution ensures correct tier 4 performance and speculative tier promotion readiness
- optimized_native support enables Runa runtime for advanced optimized execution workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Heavily optimized native execution with advanced compilation pipeline and optimization engine
- Inter-procedural analysis and global optimization coordination with performance monitoring
- Advanced vectorization and aggressive inlining with loop optimization and register allocation
- Profile-guided recompilation and optimization feedback with performance improvement analysis
- Integration with speculative tier promotion and optimization systems
