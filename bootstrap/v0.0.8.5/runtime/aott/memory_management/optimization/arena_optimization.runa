This file implements AOTT arena optimization for the Runa runtime AOTT system.

AOTT ARENA OPTIMIZATION - Arena-Specific AOTT Optimizations
- Process arena allocation optimization and arena performance enhancement
- Handle arena capacity optimization and arena growth strategies
- Manage arena reset optimization and arena reuse strategies
- Process arena memory layout optimization and arena cache optimization
- Handle arena integration with AOTT tier system and arena profiling

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Arena optimization enables AOTT-specific arena performance enhancements
- Proper arena optimization ensures optimal arena allocation and cleanup performance
- Arena optimization support enables Runa AOTT for advanced arena optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Arena allocation optimization and performance enhancement
- Arena capacity optimization and growth strategies
- Arena reset optimization and reuse strategies
- Arena memory layout optimization and cache optimization
- Arena integration with AOTT tier system and profiling
