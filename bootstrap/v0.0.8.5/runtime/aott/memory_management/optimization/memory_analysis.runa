This file implements AOTT memory analysis for the Runa runtime AOTT system.

AOTT MEMORY ANALYSIS - AOTT Memory Analysis and Optimization
- Process memory usage analysis and memory pattern identification
- Handle memory allocation analysis and memory deallocation analysis
- Manage memory leak detection and memory corruption detection
- Process memory performance analysis and memory optimization opportunities
- Handle memory integration with AOTT tier system and memory profiling

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Memory analysis enables AOTT-specific memory performance analysis
- Proper memory analysis ensures optimal memory usage and performance
- Memory analysis support enables Runa AOTT for advanced memory analysis workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Memory usage analysis and pattern identification
- Memory allocation and deallocation analysis
- Memory leak detection and corruption detection
- Memory performance analysis and optimization opportunities
- Memory integration with AOTT tier system and profiling
