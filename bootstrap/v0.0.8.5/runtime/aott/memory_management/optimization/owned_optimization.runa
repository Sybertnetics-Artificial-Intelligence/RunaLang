This file implements AOTT owned heap optimization for the Runa runtime AOTT system.

AOTT OWNED HEAP OPTIMIZATION - Owned Heap-Specific AOTT Optimizations
- Process owned heap allocation optimization and owned heap performance enhancement
- Handle owned heap ownership optimization and owned heap transfer strategies
- Manage owned heap cleanup optimization and owned heap destruction strategies
- Process owned heap memory layout optimization and owned heap cache optimization
- Handle owned heap integration with AOTT tier system and owned heap profiling

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Owned heap optimization enables AOTT-specific owned heap performance enhancements
- Proper owned heap optimization ensures optimal owned heap allocation and cleanup performance
- Owned heap optimization support enables Runa AOTT for advanced owned heap optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Owned heap allocation optimization and performance enhancement
- Owned heap ownership optimization and transfer strategies
- Owned heap cleanup optimization and destruction strategies
- Owned heap memory layout optimization and cache optimization
- Owned heap integration with AOTT tier system and profiling
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement owned heap optimization functionality
