Note:
This file implements GC safe point insertion and management for the AOTT compilation system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process safe point insertion analysis and placement optimization for garbage collection coordination
- Handle stack frame analysis for GC root identification and safe point optimization
- Manage cross-tier safe point coordination and consistency with minimal performance overhead
- Process profile-guided safe point placement optimization and speculative safe points
- Handle integration with speculative optimization and deoptimization systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- gc_safe_points enables comprehensive GC integration and safe point management
- Proper safe point handling ensures correct garbage collection coordination and performance
- gc_safe_points support enables Runa compilation for advanced GC integration workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Safe point insertion and placement optimization with GC coordination
- Stack map generation and GC root identification for safe points
- Safe point synchronization and GC request handling across threads
- Speculative safe point insertion and profile-guided optimization
- Cross-tier safe point management and deoptimization coordination
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement gc_safe_points functionality
