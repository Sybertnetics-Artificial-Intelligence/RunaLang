Note:
This file implements GC-safe code patching for the AOTT compilation system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process safe code patching with GC coordination and synchronization for runtime code modification
- Handle hot-swapping of optimized code, deoptimization patching, and profile-guided code updates
- Manage atomic code updates with rollback capabilities and patch validation
- Process cross-tier code patching coordination and patch integrity verification
- Handle speculation guard patching and execution state restoration

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- code_patching enables comprehensive GC-safe code modification and hot code swapping
- Proper code patching ensures correct runtime optimization and deoptimization handling
- code_patching support enables Runa compilation for advanced runtime code modification workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- GC-safe code patch application with atomicity guarantees and rollback support
- Hot code swapping between optimization tiers with active frame handling
- Deoptimization patching for failed speculation with state restoration
- Patch validation and correctness verification with integrity testing
- Cross-tier code patching coordination and speculation guard management
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement code_patching functionality
