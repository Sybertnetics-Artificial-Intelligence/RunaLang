Note:
This file implements GC root scanning integration for the AOTT compilation system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process efficient GC root enumeration in compiled stack frames and root scanning optimization
- Handle stack walking integration for compiled code and object reference validation
- Manage cross-tier root scanning coordination and consistency with type safety verification
- Process profile-guided root scanning optimization and parallel scanning techniques
- Handle conservative and precise root scanning with performance optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- root_scanning enables comprehensive GC root identification and scanning optimization
- Proper root scanning ensures correct garbage collection and memory management
- root_scanning support enables Runa compilation for advanced GC integration workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- GC root scanning with precise and conservative scanning strategies
- Stack frame root scanning and object reference validation
- Parallel and incremental root scanning with performance optimization
- Stack walking integration and frame boundary identification
- Root scanning performance optimization and caching strategies
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement root_scanning functionality
