Note:
This file implements stack map generation and management for the AOTT compilation system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process precise stack map generation for compiled functions and GC root location tracking
- Handle stack map optimization for minimal memory overhead and cross-tier coordination
- Manage stack map validation and correctness verification with speculative optimization support
- Process stack map compression and redundant map merging for storage efficiency
- Handle integration with deoptimization and speculation systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- stack_maps enables comprehensive GC integration and precise root identification
- Proper stack map management ensures correct garbage collection and memory safety
- stack_maps support enables Runa compilation for advanced GC integration workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Stack map generation and frame layout analysis for GC root identification
- Stack map optimization and compression for memory efficiency
- Stack map validation and integrity testing with correctness verification
- Cross-tier stack map coordination and tier adaptation
- Stack map caching and performance optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement stack_maps functionality
