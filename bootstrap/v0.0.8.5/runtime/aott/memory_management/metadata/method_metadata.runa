Note:
This file implements comprehensive metadata management for compiled methods in the AOTT system for the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process method compilation metadata storage and retrieval with optimization decision tracking
- Handle performance characteristics and dependencies for each compiled method across optimization tiers
- Manage intelligent recompilation decisions, tier transitions, and performance analysis
- Process cross-tier compilation metadata coordination and metadata-driven optimization decisions
- Handle integration with profiling and speculation systems

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- method_metadata enables comprehensive compilation metadata management and optimization tracking
- Proper method metadata ensures correct recompilation decisions and performance optimization
- method_metadata support enables Runa compilation for advanced compilation workflow management

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Method metadata creation and management with compilation and optimization information
- Performance analysis and optimization effectiveness tracking with trend analysis
- Recompilation benefit prediction and tier transition recommendation
- Cross-tier metadata coordination and dependency tracking
- Integration with profiling and speculation systems for comprehensive optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement method_metadata functionality
