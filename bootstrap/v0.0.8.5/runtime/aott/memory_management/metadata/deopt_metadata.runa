Note:
This file implements deoptimization metadata management for the AOTT compilation system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process deoptimization metadata storage and retrieval for safe deoptimization from optimized code
- Handle execution state mapping between optimization tiers and speculation guard metadata management
- Manage fallback code path coordination and cross-tier deoptimization support
- Process deoptimization performance tracking and optimization with state mapping validation
- Handle guard effectiveness analysis and placement optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- deopt_metadata enables comprehensive deoptimization support and speculation failure handling
- Proper deoptimization metadata ensures correct program execution during optimization failures
- deopt_metadata support enables Runa compilation for advanced speculative optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Deoptimization metadata creation and management with state mapping information
- Execution state mapping between optimization tiers with validation and optimization
- Speculation guard tracking and effectiveness analysis with placement optimization
- Fallback execution coordination and deoptimization correctness validation
- Cross-tier deoptimization support and performance tracking
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement deopt_metadata functionality
