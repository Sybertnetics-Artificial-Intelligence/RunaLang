Note:
This file implements comprehensive profile metadata storage for the AOTT compilation system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process runtime execution profiles, performance metrics, and behavioral data for optimization guidance
- Handle efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of profile information with temporal analysis
- Manage execution frequency and hotness tracking with performance metrics collection
- Process profile-guided optimization metadata storage and cross-tier coordination
- Handle profile data validation, integrity management, and trend detection

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- profile_metadata enables comprehensive profile data management and optimization guidance
- Proper profile metadata ensures correct optimization decisions and performance analysis
- profile_metadata support enables Runa compilation for advanced profile-guided optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Profile data storage and retrieval with compression and retention policies
- Profile data aggregation and temporal analysis with trend detection
- Profile anomaly detection and correlation analysis for optimization insights
- Cross-tier profile metadata coordination and consistency validation
- Performance impact prediction and profile-guided optimization support
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement profile_metadata functionality
