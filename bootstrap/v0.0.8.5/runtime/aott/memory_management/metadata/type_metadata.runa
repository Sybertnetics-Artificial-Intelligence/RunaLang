Note:
This file implements type metadata caching for the AOTT compilation system in the Runa runtime.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process cached type information, type layout data, and type-based optimization metadata
- Handle efficient type lookup, inheritance analysis, and type compatibility checking
- Manage type layout and size information with inheritance hierarchy caching
- Process type-based optimization metadata tracking and cross-tier coordination
- Handle type compatibility and conversion analysis with allocation pattern analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- type_metadata enables comprehensive type information caching and optimization support
- Proper type metadata ensures correct compilation acceleration and type-based optimizations
- type_metadata support enables Runa compilation for advanced type-driven optimization workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Type metadata caching and retrieval with efficient lookup and storage
- Type layout analysis and optimization with inheritance hierarchy management
- Type-based optimization opportunity identification and specialization support
- Cross-tier type metadata coordination and consistency management
- Type allocation pattern analysis and optimization barrier identification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement type_metadata functionality
