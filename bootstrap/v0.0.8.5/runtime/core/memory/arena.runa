This file implements TIER 2: ARENA allocation for the Runa runtime memory system.

ARENA ALLOCATION - Fast Bulk, O(1) Cleanup
- Process bulk temporary allocations with single-operation lifetime
- Handle arena creation, allocation, and destruction
- Manage arena growth and capacity management
- Process arena string operations and memory utilities
- Handle arena reset and reuse functionality

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Arena allocation enables fast bulk temporary allocations
- Proper arena handling ensures O(1) cleanup for thousands of allocations
- Arena support enables Runa runtime for high-performance temporary data workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Arena creation and destruction
- Arena allocation and deallocation (bulk)
- Arena string operations and utilities
- Arena capacity management and growth
- Arena reset and reuse functionality
