This file implements TIER 3: OWNED HEAP allocation for the Runa runtime memory system.

OWNED HEAP ALLOCATION - Permanent, Structured
- Process individually-managed heap allocations with structured ownership
- Handle owned memory allocation and deterministic cleanup
- Manage ownership tracking and memory safety
- Process owned string operations and memory utilities
- Handle ownership transfer and memory validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Owned heap allocation enables permanent structured data storage
- Proper owned memory handling ensures deterministic cleanup and memory safety
- Owned heap support enables Runa runtime for permanent data workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Owned memory allocation and deallocation
- Ownership tracking and validation
- Owned string operations and utilities
- Memory safety checks and validation
- Ownership transfer and management
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement owned heap functionality
