This file implements TIER 4: SHARED HEAP allocation for the Runa runtime memory system.

SHARED HEAP ALLOCATION - Multiple Owners, Manual Refcount
- Process reference-counted heap allocations with multiple owners
- Handle manual reference counting with retain/release operations
- Manage shared memory allocation and automatic cleanup
- Process shared string operations and memory utilities
- Handle cycle detection and weak reference management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Shared heap allocation enables multiple owners with manual control
- Proper shared memory handling ensures thread-safe reference counting
- Shared heap support enables Runa runtime for shared resource workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Shared memory allocation and deallocation
- Manual reference counting (retain/release)
- Shared string operations and utilities
- Cycle detection and weak references
- Thread-safe reference counting
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement shared heap functionality
