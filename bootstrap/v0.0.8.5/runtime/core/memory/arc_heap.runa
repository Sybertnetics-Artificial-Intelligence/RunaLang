Note:
This file implements TIER 5: ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) for the Runa runtime memory system.

ARC ALLOCATION - Multiple Owners, Auto Refcount
- Process compiler-managed reference counting with automatic retain/release
- Handle ARC memory allocation and automatic cleanup
- Manage ARC string operations and memory utilities
- Process cycle detection and weak reference management
- Handle ARC integration with compiler analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- ARC allocation enables automatic reference counting with zero manual effort
- Proper ARC handling ensures compiler-managed memory safety
- ARC support enables Runa runtime for convenient shared resource workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- ARC memory allocation and deallocation
- Automatic reference counting (compiler-managed)
- ARC string operations and utilities
- Cycle detection and weak references
- Compiler integration and analysis
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement ARC heap functionality
