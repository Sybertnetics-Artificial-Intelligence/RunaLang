This file handles generic instantiation and generic type management for the Runa runtime core system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process generic instantiation and generic type management
- Handle generic type creation and generic type resolution
- Manage generic type constraints and generic type coordination
- Process generic instantiation error handling and generic instantiation feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- generic_instantiation enables comprehensive generic instantiation and generic type management
- Proper generic instantiation handling ensures correct generic type management and user experience
- generic_instantiation support enables Runa compilation for generic instantiation workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Generic instantiation and generic type management
- Generic type creation and generic type resolution
- Generic type constraints and generic type coordination
- Generic instantiation error handling and generic instantiation feedback
