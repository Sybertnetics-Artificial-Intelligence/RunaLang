Note:
This file handles call stack tracing and debugging call stack operations for the Runa runtime services.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process call stack tracing and debugging call stack operations
- Handle call stack operations and call stack coordination
- Manage call stack synchronization and call stack state
- Process call stack error handling and call stack feedback

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- call_stack_tracer enables comprehensive call stack tracing and debugging call stack operations
- Proper call stack handling ensures correct debugging operations and user experience
- call_stack_tracer support enables Runa compilation for debugging call stack workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Call stack tracing and debugging call stack operations
- Call stack operations and call stack coordination
- Call stack synchronization and call stack state
- Call stack error handling and call stack feedback
