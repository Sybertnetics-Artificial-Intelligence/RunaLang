Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test "to" (exclusive) - should loop 4 times (1,2,3,4)
    Let count_to be 0
    For i from 1 to 5:
        Set count_to to count_to plus 1
    End For
    
    Note: Test "through" (inclusive) - should loop 5 times (1,2,3,4,5)
    Let count_through be 0
    For j from 1 through 5:
        Set count_through to count_through plus 1
    End For
    
    Note: Verify results
    If count_to is equal to 4:
        If count_through is equal to 5:
            Display "SUCCESS: to=4, through=5"
            Return 0  Note: Success!
        End If
    End If
    
    Display "FAILURE"
    Return 1  Note: Failure
End Process
