# PURE RUNA CRYPTOGRAPHY LIBRARY IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

**Status:** DEFERRED UNTIL v0.0.8.5 COMPILER IS OPERATIONAL
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Required for production-grade security
**Complexity:** ~10,000+ lines of production-perfect cryptographic code
**Testing Strategy:** Incremental with RFC test vectors

---

## Executive Summary

The Runa import security system (`compiler/frontend/import_system/security.runa`) currently contains **temporary placeholder implementations** for cryptographic operations. These placeholders perform basic format validation only and **are NOT production-ready**.

To achieve true security independence and fulfill Runa's mission as a self-sufficient language, we **MUST** implement a complete Pure Runa Cryptography Library with **ZERO external dependencies**.

**Philosophy:** If Runa's goal is to be faster and better than all other languages, we cannot depend on C libraries (OpenSSL, etc.). We must implement cryptography ourselves, perfectly.

---

## Current Placeholder Functions Requiring Cryptography

### 1. **SSL/TLS Certificate Validation** (`check_ssl_certificate`)
- **Location:** `security.runa:282`
- **Current State:** Basic domain format validation (checks for dots)
- **Required:** Complete SSL/TLS certificate verification

### 2. **Git Repository Signature Verification** (`verify_git_signature`)
- **Location:** `security.runa:425`
- **Current State:** Basic repo path format validation
- **Required:** GPG/PGP signature verification

### 3. **Package Digital Signatures** (`verify_digital_signature`)
- **Location:** `security.runa:571`
- **Current State:** Basic PEM format validation

### 4. **Network Client HTTPS Support** (`remote.runa`)
- **Location:** `remote.runa:139-242` (initialize_network_client, https_download_file, query_package_registry)
- **Current State:** HTTP client fully implemented, HTTPS blocked on TLS/SSL
- **Required:** TLS/SSL implementation for secure network operations
- **Affected Functions:**
  - `initialize_network_client` - Network client initialization (currently uses HTTP only)
  - `https_download_file` - HTTPS file downloads (blocked on TLS)
  - `query_package_registry` - Package registry queries (blocked - registries use HTTPS)
  - Registry endpoints (npm, crates.io, PyPI all require HTTPS)

---

## HTTP/HTTPS Client Implementation Requirements

### HTTP Client (Non-Secure) - CAN IMPLEMENT NOW
**Status:** Can be implemented immediately with existing capabilities
**Dependencies:** TCP sockets (syscalls) + HTTP protocol string parsing

   - Redirect handling (301, 302, 307, 308)
   - Connection keep-alive
   - Request/response body handling

**Implementation Location:** `stdlib/network/http_client.runa`

**Example Usage:**
```runa
Import "stdlib/network/http_client.runa" as HTTP

Let response be proc http_get from HTTP with "http://example.com/api/data"
If response is not equal to 0:
    Let status_code be proc get_status_code from HTTP with response
    Let body be proc get_response_body from HTTP with response
End If
```

## Testing Strategy

   - RSA: NIST CAVP test vectors
   - ECDSA: NIST CAVP and Wycheproof vectors
   - TLS: Test against real servers

3. **Integration Tests:**
   - Full certificate chain validation
   - TLS handshake with major sites (github.com, google.com)
   - Invalid certificate rejection

4. **Security Tests:**
   - Timing attack resistance
   - Invalid input handling
   - Buffer overflow protection

## Security Considerations

### Critical Security Requirements

1. **Constant-Time Operations:**
   - All cryptographic operations must be timing-attack resistant
   - No branching based on secret values
   - Use constant-time comparison for signatures

2. **Side-Channel Resistance:**
   - Cache-timing attack prevention
   - Power analysis resistance (where applicable)

3. **Random Number Generation:**
   - Cryptographically secure RNG required
   - Use OS entropy sources (/dev/urandom, getrandom())

4. **Input Validation:**
   - All inputs must be validated
   - Reject invalid keys, signatures, certificates immediately
   - No undefined behavior on malformed input

5. **Memory Safety:**
   - Zero sensitive data after use
   - No buffer overflows
   - Proper memory management (no leaks)

## Conclusion

This is an **ambitious but necessary project** for Runa's independence. We will not compromise by using external libraries. We will implement cryptography ourselves, to perfection, and prove that Runa can stand alone.

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete v0.0.8.5 compiler implementation
2. Set up incremental testing infrastructure
3. Begin Phase 1: Big Integer Arithmetic
4. Test, refine, and iterate until perfect

**We build it right. We build it once. We build it in Pure Runa.**
