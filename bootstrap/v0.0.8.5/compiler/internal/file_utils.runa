This file handles file operations and file utility operations for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process file I/O operations and file management utilities
- Handle file path operations and file system utilities
- Manage file optimization and file performance utilities
- Process file validation and file processing operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- File operations are fundamental to compiler source code reading and output generation
- Proper file handling ensures efficient compiler file I/O and source code processing
- File utilities support source file reading, output file writing, and include processing

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- File I/O operations and file management utilities
- File path operations and file system utilities
- File optimization and file performance utilities
- File validation and file processing operations
