Note:
This file handles arena allocator and arena utility operations for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process arena allocation and arena memory management operations
- Handle arena optimization and arena performance utilities
- Manage arena safety and arena validation operations
- Process arena debugging and arena diagnostic utilities

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Arena allocation is fundamental to compiler memory management and performance
- Proper arena handling ensures efficient compiler memory allocation and fast deallocation
- Arena utilities support temporary memory allocation during compilation phases

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Arena allocation and arena memory management operations
- Arena optimization and arena performance utilities
- Arena safety and arena validation operations
- Arena debugging and arena diagnostic utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement arena utilities functionality
