Note:
This file handles error management and error utility operations for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process error handling and error management operations
- Handle error reporting and error diagnostic utilities
- Manage error recovery and error handling strategies
- Process error optimization and error performance utilities

This file is essential because of the following reasons:

- Proper error handling ensures clear diagnostic messages and graceful failure handling
- Error utilities support all compiler phases that need error reporting and recovery

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Error handling and error management operations
- Error reporting and error diagnostic utilities
- Error recovery and error handling strategies
- Error optimization and error performance utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement error utilities functionality
