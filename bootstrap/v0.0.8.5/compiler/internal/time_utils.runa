Note:
This file handles time utilities and time management operations for the Runa compiler internal system.

TIME UTILITIES - Compiler Time Management Engine
- Process time retrieval and time measurement operations for compiler timing
- Handle time formatting and time parsing for compiler logs and timestamps
- Manage sleep operations and time delays for compiler timing control
- Process time arithmetic and time comparison for compiler scheduling
- Handle integration with OS time syscalls for accurate time operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Time utilities enable accurate performance measurement and profiling
- Proper time handling ensures correct compiler logging and diagnostics
- Time operations support compiler scheduling and timeout handling
- Time utilities provide comprehensive timing support for all compiler operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Time retrieval using clock_gettime syscall
- Time formatting for human-readable output
- Sleep operations using nanosleep syscall
- Time arithmetic (add, subtract, compare, diff)
- Integration with compiler phases for timing and profiling

Dependencies:
- Imports memory_utils.runa for time structure allocation
- Imports string_utils.runa for time formatting
- Uses direct Linux syscalls for time operations (no C runtime)

Private Process called "time_is_leap_year" takes year as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Check if year is a leap year
    Note: Returns 1 if leap year, 0 if not
    Note: Leap year rules: divisible by 4, except century years unless divisible by 400

    Let is_div_4 be year modulo by 4
    If is_div_4 is not equal to 0:
        Return 0  Note: Not divisible by 4, not leap year
    End If

    If is_div_100 is not equal to 0:
        Return 1  Note: Divisible by 4 but not 100, is leap year
    End If

    Let is_div_400 be year modulo by 400
    If is_div_400 is equal to 0:
        Return 1  Note: Divisible by 400, is leap year
    End If

    Return 0  Note: Divisible by 100 but not 400, not leap year
End Process

Private Process called "time_append_string" takes buffer as Integer, position as Integer, string as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Append string to buffer at position
    Note: Returns new position after append

    Let str_len be proc string_length from StringCore with string

        Set position to position plus 1
        Set i to i plus 1
    End While

    Return position
End Process

Private Process called "time_append_padded_int" takes buffer as Integer, position as Integer, value as Integer, width as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Append zero-padded integer to buffer (e.g., 5 -> "05" for width=2)
    Note: Returns new position after append

    Note: Convert to string
    Let temp_buf be proc allocate from MemoryUtils with 32
    If temp_buf is equal to 0:
        Return position
    End If

    Note: Extract digits (reverse order)

        Set temp_val to temp_val divided by 10
        If temp_val is equal to 0:
            Set digit_count to max_digits  Note: Exit loop
        End If
    End While

    Note: Pad with zeros if needed
    While digit_count is less than width:
        Let dummy2 be proc memory_set_byte from MemoryCore with buffer, position, 48  Note: '0'
        Set position to position plus 1
        Set digit_count to digit_count plus 1
    End While

    Note: Copy digits in reverse order
    Let i be digit_count minus 1

        Let dummy3 be proc memory_set_byte from MemoryCore with buffer, position, digit_char
