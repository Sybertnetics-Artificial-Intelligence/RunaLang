Note:
This file handles memory management and memory utility operations for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process memory allocation and memory management operations
- Handle memory optimization and memory performance utilities
- Manage memory safety and memory validation operations
- Process memory debugging and memory diagnostic utilities

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Memory management is fundamental to compiler operation and memory safety
- Proper memory handling ensures efficient compiler memory usage and prevents memory leaks
- Memory utilities support all compiler phases that need memory allocation and management

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Memory allocation and memory management operations
- Memory optimization and memory performance utilities
- Memory safety and memory validation operations
- Memory debugging and memory diagnostic utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement memory utilities functionality
