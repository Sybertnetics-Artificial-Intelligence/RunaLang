Note:
This file handles buffer management and buffer utility operations for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process buffer allocation and buffer management operations
- Handle buffer resizing and buffer capacity management
- Manage buffer operations and buffer manipulation utilities
- Process buffer optimization and buffer performance utilities

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Buffer management is fundamental to compiler operation and memory handling
- Proper buffer handling ensures efficient compiler memory usage and performance
- Buffer utilities support all compiler phases that need temporary storage

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Buffer allocation and buffer management operations
- Buffer resizing and buffer capacity management
- Buffer operations and buffer manipulation utilities
- Buffer optimization and buffer performance utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement buffer utilities functionality
