Note:
This file handles debugging and debug utility operations for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process debug information generation and debug symbol management
- Handle debug output and debug diagnostic utilities
- Manage debug optimization and debug performance utilities
- Process debug validation and debug processing operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Debug utilities are fundamental to compiler debugging support and development tools
- Proper debug handling ensures effective compiler debugging and development experience
- Debug utilities support debug symbol generation and debugging information output

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Debug information generation and debug symbol management
- Debug output and debug diagnostic utilities
- Debug optimization and debug performance utilities
- Debug validation and debug processing operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement debug utilities functionality
