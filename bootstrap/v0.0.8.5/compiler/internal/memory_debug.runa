This file handles memory debugging and memory diagnostic utilities for the Runa compiler internal system.

MEMORY DEBUGGING - Compiler Memory Diagnostic Engine
- Process memory debugging and memory diagnostic utilities for compiler operations
- Handle memory leak detection and memory usage tracking for compiler performance
- Manage memory profiling and memory analysis for compiler memory optimization
- Process memory error reporting and memory visualization for compiler debugging
- Handle integration with compiler phases for memory debugging and diagnostics

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Memory debugging enables efficient identification and resolution of memory-related issues in the compiler
- Proper memory debugging handling ensures correct compiler memory usage and performance
- Memory debugging utilities support all compiler phases that need memory diagnostics and analysis
- Memory debugging provides comprehensive memory analysis for compiler operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Memory leak detection and analysis operations
- Memory usage tracking and profiling operations
- Memory error reporting and visualization operations
- Memory debugging optimization and performance monitoring
- Integration with compiler phases for memory debugging and diagnostics

Dependencies:
- Imports debug_utils.runa for general debugging utilities
- Imports collections.runa for memory debugging data structure management
- Imports error_utils.runa for memory error reporting
