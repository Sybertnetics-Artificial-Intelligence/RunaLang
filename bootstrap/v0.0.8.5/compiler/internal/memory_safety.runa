This file handles memory safety and memory validation operations for the Runa compiler internal system.

MEMORY SAFETY - Compiler Memory Validation Engine
- Process memory safety checks and memory validation operations for compiler data
- Handle memory bounds checking and null pointer dereference detection for compiler operations
- Manage memory corruption detection and memory error reporting for compiler stability
- Process memory safety optimization and memory safety performance utilities for compiler efficiency
- Handle integration with compiler phases for memory safety validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Memory safety enables robust compiler operation and prevents memory-related crashes
- Proper memory safety handling ensures correct compiler memory usage and data integrity
- Memory safety utilities support all compiler phases that need memory validation and error detection
- Memory safety validation provides deterministic memory management for compiler operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Memory bounds checking and validation operations
- Null pointer dereference detection and prevention
- Memory corruption detection and error reporting
- Memory safety optimization and performance monitoring
- Integration with compiler phases for memory safety validation

Dependencies:
- Imports memory_utils.runa for memory allocation and operations
- Imports memory_core.runa for low-level memory access
- Imports pointer_primitive.runa for pointer validation
