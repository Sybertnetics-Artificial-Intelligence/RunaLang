Note:
This file handles hash functions and hash utility operations for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process hash computation and hash function operations
- Handle hash table operations and hash-based data structures
- Manage hash optimization and hash performance utilities
- Process hash validation and hash collision handling

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Hash functions are fundamental to symbol tables, identifier lookup, and data structures
- Proper hash handling ensures efficient compiler symbol resolution and data access
- Hash utilities support symbol table management and identifier processing

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Hash computation and hash function operations
- Hash table operations and hash-based data structures
- Hash optimization and hash performance utilities
- Hash validation and hash collision handling
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement hash utilities functionality
