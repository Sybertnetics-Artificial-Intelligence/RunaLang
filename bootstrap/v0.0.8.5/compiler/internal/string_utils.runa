Note:
This file handles string manipulation and string utility operations for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process string operations and string manipulation utilities
- Handle string formatting and string conversion operations
- Manage string optimization and string performance utilities
- Process string validation and string processing operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- String manipulation is fundamental to compiler text processing and source code handling
- Proper string handling ensures efficient compiler text operations and string processing
- String utilities support all compiler phases that need text manipulation and processing

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- String operations and string manipulation utilities
- String formatting and string conversion operations
- String optimization and string performance utilities
- String validation and string processing operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement string utilities functionality
