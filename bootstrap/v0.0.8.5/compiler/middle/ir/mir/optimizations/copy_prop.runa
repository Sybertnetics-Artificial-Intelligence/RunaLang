Note:
This file handles copy propagation optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process copy propagation and copy elimination
- Handle copy detection and copy substitution
- Manage copy optimization and copy validation
- Process copy verification and copy analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Copy propagation improves code performance and reduces redundant operations
- Proper copy propagation ensures correct copy elimination
- Copy propagation support enables Runa compilation for optimized code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Copy propagation and copy elimination
- Copy detection and copy substitution
- Copy optimization and copy validation
- Copy verification and copy analysis
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement copy propagation functionality
