Note:
This file handles sparse conditional constant propagation optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process sparse conditional constant propagation and advanced constant analysis
- Handle conditional constant detection and conditional constant propagation
- Manage sparse constant analysis and sparse constant optimization
- Process sparse constant validation and sparse constant verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Sparse conditional constant propagation enables advanced constant analysis and optimization
- Proper SCCP handling ensures correct conditional constant identification
- SCCP support enables Runa compilation for advanced optimized code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Sparse conditional constant propagation and advanced constant analysis
- Conditional constant detection and conditional constant propagation
- Sparse constant analysis and sparse constant optimization
- Sparse constant validation and sparse constant verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement sparse conditional constant propagation functionality
