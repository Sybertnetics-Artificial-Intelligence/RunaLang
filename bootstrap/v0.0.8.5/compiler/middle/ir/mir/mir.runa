Note:
This file handles core MIR type definitions and MIR data structures.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process core MIR type definitions and MIR data structure management
- Handle MIR instruction types and MIR basic block types
- Manage MIR SSA form types and MIR phi node types
- Process MIR control flow types and MIR dominance types

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Core MIR types enable SSA form and control flow graph representation
- Proper MIR type handling ensures correct MIR data structure management
- Core MIR types support enables Runa compilation for SSA-based optimization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Core MIR type definitions and MIR data structure management
- MIR instruction types and MIR basic block types
- MIR SSA form types and MIR phi node types
- MIR control flow types and MIR dominance types
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement core MIR type definitions functionality
