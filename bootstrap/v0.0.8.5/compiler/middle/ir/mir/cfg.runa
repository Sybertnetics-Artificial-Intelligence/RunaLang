Note:
This file handles control flow graph analysis and CFG management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process control flow graph construction and CFG analysis
- Handle basic block analysis and control flow analysis
- Manage CFG optimization and CFG transformation
- Process CFG validation and CFG verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Control flow graph analysis enables loop optimization and flow analysis
- Proper CFG handling ensures correct control flow representation
- CFG analysis support enables Runa compilation for flow-based optimization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Control flow graph construction and CFG analysis
- Basic block analysis and control flow analysis
- CFG optimization and CFG transformation
- CFG validation and CFG verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement control flow graph analysis functionality
