Note:
This file handles dominance analysis and dominance tree computation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process dominance analysis and dominance tree construction
- Handle dominance frontier computation and dominance validation
- Manage dominance optimization and dominance-based analysis
- Process dominance verification and dominance tree verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Dominance analysis enables SSA construction and loop optimization
- Proper dominance handling ensures correct dominance tree computation
- Dominance analysis support enables Runa compilation for dominance-based optimization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Dominance analysis and dominance tree construction
- Dominance frontier computation and dominance validation
- Dominance optimization and dominance-based analysis
- Dominance verification and dominance tree verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement dominance analysis functionality
