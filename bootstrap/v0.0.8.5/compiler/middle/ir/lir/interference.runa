Note:
This file handles interference graph construction and register interference analysis.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process interference graph construction and register interference analysis
- Handle interference detection and interference graph optimization
- Manage interference-based register allocation and interference validation
- Process interference verification and interference analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Interference graph construction enables graph coloring register allocation
- Proper interference analysis ensures correct register conflict detection
- Interference analysis support enables Runa compilation for optimized register allocation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Interference graph construction and register interference analysis
- Interference detection and interference graph optimization
- Interference-based register allocation and interference validation
- Interference verification and interference analysis
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement interference graph construction functionality
