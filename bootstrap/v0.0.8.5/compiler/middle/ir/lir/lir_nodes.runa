Note:
This file handles LIR node definitions and LIR data structures.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process LIR node definitions and LIR data structure management
- Handle LIR instruction nodes and LIR virtual register nodes
- Manage LIR memory addressing and LIR instruction types
- Process LIR metadata and LIR optimization information

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- LIR node definitions enable low-level representation for code generation
- Proper LIR node handling ensures correct LIR data structure management
- LIR nodes support enables Runa compilation for register allocation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- LIR node definitions and LIR data structure management
- LIR instruction nodes and LIR virtual register nodes
- LIR memory addressing and LIR instruction types
- LIR metadata and LIR optimization information
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement LIR nodes functionality
