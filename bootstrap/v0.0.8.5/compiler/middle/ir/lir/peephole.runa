Note:
This file handles peephole optimization and instruction-level optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process peephole optimization and instruction-level optimization
- Handle instruction pattern matching and instruction replacement
- Manage peephole optimization and peephole transformation
- Process peephole validation and peephole verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Peephole optimization improves code performance through instruction-level optimizations
- Proper peephole optimization ensures correct instruction pattern matching
- Peephole optimization support enables Runa compilation for optimized instruction generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Peephole optimization and instruction-level optimization
- Instruction pattern matching and instruction replacement
- Peephole optimization and peephole transformation
- Peephole validation and peephole verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement peephole optimization functionality
