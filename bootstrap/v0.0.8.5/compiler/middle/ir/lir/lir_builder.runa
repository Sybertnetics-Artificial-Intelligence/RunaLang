Note:
This file handles LIR construction and MIR to LIR lowering.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process MIR to LIR lowering and LIR construction
- Handle virtual register allocation and register management
- Manage memory addressing and memory operation processing
- Process instruction selection and instruction generation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- LIR construction enables low-level representation for code generation
- Proper LIR building ensures correct MIR to LIR transformation
- LIR builder support enables Runa compilation for register allocation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- MIR to LIR lowering and LIR construction
- Virtual register allocation and register management
- Memory addressing and memory operation processing
- Instruction selection and instruction generation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement LIR builder functionality
