Note:
This file handles LIR optimization and low-level code optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process LIR optimization and low-level code optimization
- Handle peephole optimization and instruction-level optimization
- Manage register optimization and register allocation optimization
- Process instruction optimization and instruction selection optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- LIR optimization enables low-level code performance optimization
- Proper LIR optimization ensures optimal low-level code generation
- LIR optimizer support enables Runa compilation for performance-optimized code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- LIR optimization and low-level code optimization
- Peephole optimization and instruction-level optimization
- Register optimization and register allocation optimization
- Instruction optimization and instruction selection optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement LIR optimizer functionality
