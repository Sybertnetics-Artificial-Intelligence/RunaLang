Note:
This file handles spill code insertion and register spilling management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process spill code insertion and register spilling management
- Handle spill slot allocation and spill code generation
- Manage spill optimization and spill code optimization
- Process spill validation and spill verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Spill code insertion enables register allocation when register pressure is high
- Proper spill handling ensures correct register spilling to memory
- Spill code support enables Runa compilation for complete register allocation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Spill code insertion and register spilling management
- Spill slot allocation and spill code generation
- Spill optimization and spill code optimization
- Spill validation and spill verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement spill code insertion functionality
