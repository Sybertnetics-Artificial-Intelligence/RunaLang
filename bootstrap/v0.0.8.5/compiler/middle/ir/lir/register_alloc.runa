Note:
This file handles register allocation algorithms and register management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process register allocation and virtual register to physical register mapping
- Handle graph coloring register allocation and register assignment
- Manage register spilling and register optimization
- Process register validation and register verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Register allocation enables efficient use of physical registers
- Proper register allocation ensures correct register assignment
- Register allocation support enables Runa compilation for optimized code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Register allocation and virtual register to physical register mapping
- Graph coloring register allocation and register assignment
- Register spilling and register optimization
- Register validation and register verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement register allocation algorithms functionality
