Note:
This file handles Bifrost graph structure for accelerator compilation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Bifrost DAG construction and node management
- Handle data flow edge creation and dependency tracking
- Manage graph traversal and topological ordering
- Process graph validation and correctness checking

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Bifrost graph represents accelerator computation as DAG
- Proper graph structure enables dataflow optimization
- Graph representation is core to Bifrost accelerator compilation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- BifrostGraph construction and node insertion
- Data flow edge management and dependency tracking
- Topological sorting for execution order
- Graph validation and cycle detection

Note: This is scaffolding for Bifrost implementation

Note: TODO - Implement Bifrost graph structure
