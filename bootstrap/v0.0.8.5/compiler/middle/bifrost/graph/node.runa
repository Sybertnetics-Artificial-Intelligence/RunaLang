Note:
This file handles Bifrost graph node definitions for accelerator compilation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Bifrost node type definitions and high-level operations
- Handle operation nodes (MatrixMultiply, Convolve2D, FFT, etc.)
- Manage data nodes and tensor types
- Process node attribute storage and metadata

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Bifrost nodes represent high-level accelerator operations
- Proper node abstraction enables cross-accelerator optimization
- Node definitions are foundation for Bifrost graph representation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- BifrostNode type definitions and operation types
- High-level operation nodes (matrix ops, convolutions, FFT)
- Data tensor nodes with shape and type information
- Node metadata and attribute management

Note: This is v0.8.5 Bifrost implementation
