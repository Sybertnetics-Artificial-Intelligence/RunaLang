This file handles MIR to Bifrost graph translation for accelerator compilation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process MIR to Bifrost graph lowering and translation
- Handle accelerator operation pattern recognition in MIR
- Manage CPU/accelerator computation partitioning
- Process Bifrost graph construction from MIR

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Bifrost builder translates MIR to accelerator-optimized representation
- Proper translation enables automatic GPU/accelerator utilization
- Builder is bridge between CPU compilation and accelerator compilation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- MIR pattern matching for accelerator operations
- Bifrost node creation from MIR instructions
- CPU/accelerator partitioning decisions
- Data transfer insertion between CPU and accelerator

Note: This is scaffolding for Bifrost implementation

Note: TODO - Implement MIR to Bifrost builder
