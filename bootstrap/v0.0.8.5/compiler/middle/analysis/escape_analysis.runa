Note:
This file handles escape analysis for automatic stack vs heap allocation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process object allocation analysis and escape detection
- Handle inter-procedural escape analysis across function boundaries
- Manage stack allocation promotion for non-escaping objects
- Process escape state tracking and lifetime analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Escape analysis enables automatic stack allocation for performance
- Proper escape analysis reduces garbage collection pressure
- Stack promotion significantly improves allocation performance

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Escape state computation (NoEscape, ArgEscape, GlobalEscape)
- Inter-procedural escape propagation through call graph
- Stack allocation promotion and lifetime verification
- Escape analysis integration with ownership tracking
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement escape analysis functionality
