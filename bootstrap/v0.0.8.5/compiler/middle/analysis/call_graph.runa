Note:
This file handles call graph construction and analysis.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process call graph construction from function calls
- Handle indirect call resolution and virtual call analysis
- Manage strongly connected component detection for recursion
- Process call graph traversal for inter-procedural analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Call graph enables inter-procedural optimization
- Proper call graph analysis is foundation for inlining decisions
- Call graph supports whole-program analysis and LTO

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Direct call edge construction
- Indirect call resolution using type information
- Recursive cycle detection using Tarjan's algorithm
- Call graph queries for optimization passes
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement call graph construction functionality
