Note:
This file handles data flow analysis and variable tracking.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process data flow analysis and variable tracking
- Handle data flow graph construction and data flow graph analysis
- Manage data flow optimization and data flow optimization
- Process data flow validation and data flow validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Data flow analysis enables variable tracking and optimization opportunities
- Proper data flow handling ensures correct variable flow tracking
- Data flow analysis support enables Runa compilation for data-aware code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Data flow analysis and variable tracking
- Data flow graph construction and data flow graph analysis
- Data flow optimization and data flow optimization
- Data flow validation and data flow validation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement data flow analysis functionality
