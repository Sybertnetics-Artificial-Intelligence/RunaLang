Note:
This file handles points-to analysis for pointer aliasing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process points-to set computation for all pointers
- Handle flow-sensitive and context-sensitive analysis
- Manage points-to graph construction and propagation
- Process alias query resolution for optimizations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Points-to analysis enables precise alias analysis
- Proper points-to information improves optimization safety
- Points-to analysis is foundation for advanced optimizations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Points-to set computation using inclusion-based analysis
- Flow-sensitive analysis for precision
- Context-sensitive analysis for inter-procedural precision
- Alias query interface for optimization passes
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement points-to analysis functionality
