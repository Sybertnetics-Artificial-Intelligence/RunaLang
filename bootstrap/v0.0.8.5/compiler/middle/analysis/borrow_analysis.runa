Note:
This file handles borrow checking for Runa's ownership system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process borrow analysis and reference validity checking
- Handle mutable and immutable borrow conflict detection
- Manage borrow scope analysis and lifetime integration
- Process borrow error detection and reporting

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Borrow checking prevents data races and aliasing violations
- Proper borrow analysis ensures reference safety
- Borrow checker is critical for Runa's memory safety guarantees

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Borrow state tracking (Shared, Exclusive, None)
- Mutable/immutable borrow conflict detection
- Two-phase borrow analysis for method calls
- Borrow scope analysis integrated with lifetime analysis
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement borrow checking functionality
