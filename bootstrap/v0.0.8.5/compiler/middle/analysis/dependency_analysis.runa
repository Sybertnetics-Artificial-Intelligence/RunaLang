Note:
This file handles dependency analysis and code dependency tracking.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process dependency analysis and code dependency tracking
- Handle dependency graph construction and dependency graph analysis
- Manage dependency optimization and dependency optimization
- Process dependency validation and dependency validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Dependency analysis enables code dependency understanding and optimization
- Proper dependency handling ensures correct code dependency tracking
- Dependency analysis support enables Runa compilation for dependency-aware code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Dependency analysis and code dependency tracking
- Dependency graph construction and dependency graph analysis
- Dependency optimization and dependency optimization
- Dependency validation and dependency validation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement dependency analysis functionality
