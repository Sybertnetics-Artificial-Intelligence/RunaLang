Note:
This file handles ownership tracking for Runa's ownership system.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process ownership transfer analysis and move semantics
- Handle ownership state tracking across control flow
- Manage partial moves and field-level ownership
- Process ownership error detection and reporting

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Ownership tracking ensures memory safety and prevents double-free
- Proper ownership analysis enables zero-cost abstractions
- Ownership system is core to Runa's safety guarantees

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Ownership state computation (Owned, Moved, Borrowed)
- Move analysis and ownership transfer tracking
- Partial move handling for struct fields
- Ownership error detection (use-after-move, double-move)
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement ownership tracking functionality
