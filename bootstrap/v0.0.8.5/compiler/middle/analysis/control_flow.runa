Note:
This file handles control flow analysis and program flow tracking.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process control flow analysis and program flow tracking
- Handle control flow graph construction and flow graph analysis
- Manage control flow optimization and flow optimization
- Process control flow validation and flow validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Control flow analysis enables program flow understanding and optimization
- Proper control flow handling ensures correct program flow tracking
- Control flow analysis support enables Runa compilation for flow-aware code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Control flow analysis and program flow tracking
- Control flow graph construction and flow graph analysis
- Control flow optimization and flow optimization
- Control flow validation and flow validation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement control flow analysis functionality
