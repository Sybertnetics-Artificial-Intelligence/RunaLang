Note:
This file handles null safety analysis and null pointer detection.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process null state tracking and nullable type analysis
- Handle null check insertion and null dereference detection
- Manage optional type unwrapping safety verification
- Process null safety error detection and reporting

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Null safety prevents null pointer dereference crashes
- Proper null analysis eliminates billion-dollar mistake
- Null safety is essential for production-grade reliability

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Null state analysis (Null, NonNull, Maybe)
- Null check propagation through control flow
- Optional type unwrapping verification
- Null dereference error detection and prevention
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement null safety analysis functionality
