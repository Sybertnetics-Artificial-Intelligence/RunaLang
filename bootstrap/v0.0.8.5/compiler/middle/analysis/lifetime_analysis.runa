Note:
This file handles lifetime analysis for borrow checker support.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process value lifetime computation and scope analysis
- Handle lifetime parameter inference and propagation
- Manage lifetime constraint generation and solving
- Process lifetime error detection and reporting

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Lifetime analysis ensures memory safety without garbage collection
- Proper lifetime tracking prevents use-after-free and dangling pointers
- Lifetime analysis is foundation for Runa's ownership system

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Lifetime region computation and scope hierarchy
- Lifetime parameter inference for generic functions
- Lifetime constraint generation from borrow operations
- Lifetime subtyping and variance analysis
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement lifetime analysis functionality
