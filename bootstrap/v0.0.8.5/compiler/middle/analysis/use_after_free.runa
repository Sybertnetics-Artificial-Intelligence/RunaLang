Note:
This file handles use-after-free detection and prevention.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process deallocation tracking and freed pointer analysis
- Handle use-after-free detection across control flow
- Manage double-free detection and prevention
- Process memory safety error reporting

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Use-after-free detection prevents critical security vulnerabilities
- Proper UAF analysis ensures memory safety
- UAF prevention is essential for production security

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Freed state tracking through control flow
- Use-after-free pattern detection
- Double-free detection and prevention
- Integration with ownership and lifetime analysis
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement use-after-free detection functionality
