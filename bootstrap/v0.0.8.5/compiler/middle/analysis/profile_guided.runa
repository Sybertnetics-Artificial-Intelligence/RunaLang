Note:
This file handles profile-guided optimization (PGO) infrastructure.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process profile data collection and instrumentation
- Handle hot path identification and branch probability analysis
- Manage profile data integration into optimization decisions
- Process profile-driven inlining and code layout

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- PGO enables data-driven optimization for real-world performance
- Proper PGO significantly improves optimization quality
- Profile data guides critical optimization decisions

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Profile instrumentation and data collection
- Branch probability computation from profile data
- Hot function and hot path identification
- Profile-driven optimization heuristics
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement profile-guided optimization infrastructure functionality
