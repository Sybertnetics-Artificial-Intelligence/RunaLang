Note:
This file handles whole-program analysis for link-time optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process whole-program call graph construction and analysis
- Handle global visibility analysis and unused code detection
- Manage whole-program type analysis and devirtualization opportunities
- Process inter-procedural analysis across entire program

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Whole-program analysis enables global optimization decisions
- Proper WPA provides complete program visibility for aggressive optimization
- WPA is foundation for maximum LTO effectiveness

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Complete program call graph construction
- Global reachability analysis from entry points
- Whole-program type hierarchy analysis
- Inter-procedural data flow analysis across entire program
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement whole-program analysis functionality
