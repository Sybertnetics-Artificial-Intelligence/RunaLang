Note:
This file handles link-time cross-module optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process inter-module function inlining and optimization
- Handle cross-module constant propagation and dead code elimination
- Manage whole-program visibility analysis for optimization opportunities
- Process module merging and unified optimization passes

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Cross-module optimization eliminates module boundary performance penalties
- Proper LTO enables aggressive whole-program optimization
- LTO is critical for maximizing performance in production builds

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Inter-module call graph construction and analysis
- Cross-module inlining decisions and implementation
- Global dead code elimination across modules
- Cross-module constant propagation and optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement cross-module optimization functionality
