Note:
This file handles code specialization and context-specific optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process code specialization and context-specific optimization
- Handle specialization analysis and specialization opportunity detection
- Manage specialization generation and specialized code generation
- Process specialization validation and specialization verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Code specialization enables context-specific code optimization
- Proper specialization handling ensures optimal specialized code generation
- Code specialization support enables Runa compilation for context-aware code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Code specialization and context-specific optimization
- Specialization analysis and specialization opportunity detection
- Specialization generation and specialized code generation
- Specialization validation and specialization verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement code specialization functionality
