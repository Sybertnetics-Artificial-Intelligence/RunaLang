Note:
This file handles type instantiation caching for monomorphization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process instantiation cache storage and retrieval
- Handle type signature normalization and hashing
- Manage cache invalidation and incremental compilation
- Process instantiation deduplication and sharing

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Instantiation caching prevents duplicate monomorphization
- Proper caching dramatically improves compilation performance
- Cache management is critical for incremental compilation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Type signature canonicalization and hashing
- Instantiation cache lookup and insertion
- Cache invalidation for incremental compilation
- Instantiation sharing across compilation units
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement type instantiation caching functionality
