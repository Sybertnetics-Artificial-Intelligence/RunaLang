Note:
This file handles trait/protocol resolution and implementation selection.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process trait implementation lookup and resolution
- Handle trait method dispatch and vtable construction
- Manage trait coherence checking and orphan rule enforcement
- Process trait object creation and dynamic dispatch

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Trait resolution enables polymorphism and abstraction
- Proper trait handling ensures correct method dispatch
- Trait resolution is foundation for Runa's protocol system

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Trait implementation search and selection
- Trait method resolution and dispatch
- Trait coherence verification (no overlapping implementations)
- Trait object construction and dynamic dispatch setup
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement trait/protocol resolution functionality
