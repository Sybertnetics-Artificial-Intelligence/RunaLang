Note:
This file handles generic type instantiation for monomorphization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process generic type parameter substitution and instantiation
- Handle type parameter constraint verification during instantiation
- Manage instantiation caching and duplicate prevention
- Process recursive generic instantiation and cycle detection

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Generic instantiation enables zero-cost generics through monomorphization
- Proper instantiation ensures type safety in generic code
- Instantiation caching prevents exponential code bloat

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Type parameter substitution in generic function/type definitions
- Constraint checking during instantiation
- Instantiation cache management and lookup
- Recursive instantiation cycle detection
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement generic type instantiation functionality
