Note:
This file handles IR lowering and high-level to low-level transformation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process IR lowering and high-level to low-level transformation
- Handle AST to IR lowering and high-level construct lowering
- Manage IR optimization and IR transformation optimization
- Process IR validation and IR transformation validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- IR lowering enables high-level constructs to be transformed into low-level IR
- Proper lowering handling ensures correct high-level to low-level transformation
- IR lowering support enables Runa compilation for multi-level code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- IR lowering and high-level to low-level transformation
- AST to IR lowering and high-level construct lowering
- IR optimization and IR transformation optimization
- IR validation and IR transformation validation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement IR lowering functionality
