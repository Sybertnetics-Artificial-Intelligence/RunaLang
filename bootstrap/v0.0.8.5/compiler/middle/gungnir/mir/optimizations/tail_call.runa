Note:
This file handles tail call optimization (TCO) for MIR.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process tail call identification and analysis
- Handle tail recursion to loop transformation
- Manage calling convention compatibility checking
- Process mutual tail recursion optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Tail call optimization enables constant stack space for recursive functions
- Proper TCO is essential for functional programming patterns
- Tail recursion elimination prevents stack overflow in deep recursion

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Tail position analysis and tail call identification
- Tail recursion to iterative loop transformation
- Mutual tail call optimization and trampoline generation
- Calling convention analysis for tail call eligibility
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement tail call optimization functionality
