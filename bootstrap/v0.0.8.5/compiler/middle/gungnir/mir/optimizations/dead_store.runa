Note:
This file handles dead store elimination optimization for MIR.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process store instruction liveness analysis
- Handle redundant store detection and elimination
- Manage store-to-load forwarding and memory dependency analysis
- Process stack slot liveness and dead stack store elimination

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Dead store elimination removes unnecessary memory writes
- Proper DSE reduces memory traffic and improves cache performance
- Store elimination is critical for reducing overhead in stack-heavy code

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Store liveness analysis using backward data flow
- Redundant store identification (store followed by store to same location)
- Dead stack allocation elimination
- Memory alias analysis integration for correctness
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement dead store elimination optimization functionality
