Note:
This file handles strength reduction optimization for MIR.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process expensive operation identification and replacement analysis
- Handle multiplication to shift conversion and division to shift conversion
- Manage modulo to bitwise AND conversion for power-of-two divisors
- Process induction variable strength reduction in loops

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Strength reduction replaces expensive operations with cheaper equivalents
- Proper strength reduction significantly improves performance on critical paths
- Induction variable optimization is critical for loop performance

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Multiplication/division to shift conversion (for power-of-two constants)
- Modulo to bitwise AND conversion (x % 2^n â†’ x & (2^n - 1))
- Induction variable identification and strength reduction
- Loop-invariant expression factoring
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement strength reduction optimization functionality
