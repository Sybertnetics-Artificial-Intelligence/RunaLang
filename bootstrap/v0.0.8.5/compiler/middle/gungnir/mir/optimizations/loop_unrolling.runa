Note:
This file handles loop unrolling optimization for MIR.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process loop structure analysis and unroll candidate selection
- Handle full loop unrolling for known iteration counts
- Manage partial loop unrolling with remainder handling
- Process loop body cloning and induction variable adjustment

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Loop unrolling reduces branch overhead and enables instruction-level parallelism
- Proper unrolling exposes optimization opportunities across iterations
- Unrolling is critical for vectorization and CPU pipeline utilization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Trip count analysis and constant iteration detection
- Full unrolling for small constant-count loops
- Partial unrolling with configurable unroll factors
- Remainder loop generation and phi node rewriting
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement loop unrolling optimization functionality
