Note:
This file handles scalar replacement of aggregates (SROa) optimization for MIR.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process aggregate allocation analysis and field usage tracking
- Handle aggregate-to-scalar decomposition for local allocations
- Manage field-level SSA promotion and scalar optimization
- Process aggregate reconstruction elimination

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Scalar replacement eliminates unnecessary allocations
- Proper SROA enables register allocation for struct fields
- SROA is critical for zero-cost abstraction performance

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Aggregate escape analysis for SROA eligibility
- Field-level decomposition and SSA value creation
- Load/store elimination after scalarization
- Aggregate reconstruction analysis
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement scalar replacement of aggregates functionality
