Note:
This file handles dead code elimination optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process dead code elimination and unused code removal
- Handle dead instruction detection and dead block removal
- Manage dead variable elimination and dead function removal
- Process dead code validation and dead code verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Dead code elimination improves code performance and reduces size
- Proper DCE handling ensures correct dead code identification
- DCE support enables Runa compilation for optimized code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Dead code elimination and unused code removal
- Dead instruction detection and dead block removal
- Dead variable elimination and dead function removal
- Dead code validation and dead code verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement dead code elimination functionality
