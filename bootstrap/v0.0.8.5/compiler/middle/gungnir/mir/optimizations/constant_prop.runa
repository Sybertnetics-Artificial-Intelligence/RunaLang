Note:
This file handles constant propagation optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process constant propagation and constant value tracking
- Handle constant folding and constant expression evaluation
- Manage constant substitution and constant optimization
- Process constant validation and constant verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Constant propagation improves code performance and enables further optimizations
- Proper constant propagation ensures correct constant value tracking
- Constant propagation support enables Runa compilation for optimized code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Constant propagation and constant value tracking
- Constant folding and constant expression evaluation
- Constant substitution and constant optimization
- Constant validation and constant verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement constant propagation functionality
