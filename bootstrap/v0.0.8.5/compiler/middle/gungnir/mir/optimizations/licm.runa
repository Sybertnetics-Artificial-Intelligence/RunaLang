Note:
This file handles loop-invariant code motion optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process loop-invariant code motion and loop optimization
- Handle invariant detection and invariant hoisting
- Manage loop optimization and loop transformation
- Process loop validation and loop verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Loop-invariant code motion improves loop performance and reduces redundant computations
- Proper LICM handling ensures correct invariant identification
- LICM support enables Runa compilation for optimized loop code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Loop-invariant code motion and loop optimization
- Invariant detection and invariant hoisting
- Loop optimization and loop transformation
- Loop validation and loop verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement loop-invariant code motion functionality
