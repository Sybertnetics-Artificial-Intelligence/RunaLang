Note:
This file handles Global Value Numbering (GVN) optimization for MIR.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process value numbering assignment using SSA properties
- Handle redundant computation detection across basic blocks
- Manage value equivalence propagation and replacement
- Process congruence class computation and phi node handling

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- GVN eliminates redundant computations globally across the function
- Proper GVN subsumes local CSE and provides superior optimization
- GVN with SSA form enables powerful value-based optimizations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Value number assignment and congruence class partitioning
- Dominator-tree-based value propagation
- Redundant load elimination and memory SSA integration
- Phi node congruence and loop-carried value handling

Note: TODO - Implement Global Value Numbering optimization functionality
