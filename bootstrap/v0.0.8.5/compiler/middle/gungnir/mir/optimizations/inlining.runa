Note:
This file handles function inlining optimization for MIR.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process function call analysis and inlining candidate selection
- Handle inline cost calculation and benefit analysis
- Manage function body cloning and SSA value remapping
- Process recursive inlining prevention and depth limiting

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Function inlining eliminates call overhead and enables further optimizations
- Proper inlining decisions balance code size against performance gains
- Inlining support enables inter-procedural optimization opportunities

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Inline candidate selection and cost-benefit analysis
- Function body cloning and parameter substitution
- SSA value remapping and phi node adjustment
- Recursive inlining detection and heuristic-based decisions
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement function inlining optimization functionality
