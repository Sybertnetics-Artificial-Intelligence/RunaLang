Note:
This file handles MIR optimization and SSA-based code optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process MIR optimization and SSA-based code optimization
- Handle dead code elimination and constant propagation
- Manage common subexpression elimination and loop optimization
- Process SSA-based optimization and control flow optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- MIR optimization enables SSA-based code performance optimization
- Proper MIR optimization ensures optimal SSA-based code generation
- MIR optimizer support enables Runa compilation for SSA-based performance optimization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- MIR optimization and SSA-based code optimization
- Dead code elimination and constant propagation
- Common subexpression elimination and loop optimization
- SSA-based optimization and control flow optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement MIR optimizer functionality
