Note:
This file handles MIR verification and SSA form validation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process MIR verification and SSA form validation
- Handle control flow graph validation and basic block validation
- Manage SSA form correctness and phi node validation
- Process MIR consistency checking and MIR integrity validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- MIR verification ensures SSA form correctness and control flow graph validity
- Proper MIR verification ensures correct MIR representation
- MIR verifier support enables Runa compilation for reliable SSA-based optimization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- MIR verification and SSA form validation
- Control flow graph validation and basic block validation
- SSA form correctness and phi node validation
- MIR consistency checking and MIR integrity validation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement MIR verifier functionality
