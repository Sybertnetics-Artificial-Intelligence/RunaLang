Note:
This file handles instruction selection and target-specific instruction generation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process instruction selection and target-specific instruction generation
- Handle instruction mapping and instruction optimization
- Manage instruction validation and instruction verification
- Process instruction analysis and instruction transformation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Instruction selection enables target-specific code generation
- Proper instruction selection ensures correct target instruction mapping
- Instruction selection support enables Runa compilation for multi-target code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Instruction selection and target-specific instruction generation
- Instruction mapping and instruction optimization
- Instruction validation and instruction verification
- Instruction analysis and instruction transformation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement instruction selection functionality
