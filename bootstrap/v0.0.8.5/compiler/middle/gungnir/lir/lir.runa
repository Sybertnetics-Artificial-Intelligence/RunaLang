Note:
This file handles core LIR type definitions and LIR data structures.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process core LIR type definitions and LIR data structure management
- Handle LIR instruction types and LIR virtual register types
- Manage LIR memory addressing types and LIR optimization types
- Process LIR metadata types and LIR code generation types

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Core LIR types enable low-level representation for code generation
- Proper LIR type handling ensures correct LIR data structure management
- Core LIR types support enables Runa compilation for register allocation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Core LIR type definitions and LIR data structure management
- LIR instruction types and LIR virtual register types
- LIR memory addressing types and LIR optimization types
- LIR metadata types and LIR code generation types
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement core LIR type definitions functionality
