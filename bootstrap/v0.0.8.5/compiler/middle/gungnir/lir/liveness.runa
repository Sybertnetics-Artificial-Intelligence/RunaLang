Note:
This file handles liveness analysis and variable liveness tracking.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process liveness analysis and variable liveness computation
- Handle live range analysis and live variable tracking
- Manage liveness optimization and liveness-based analysis
- Process liveness validation and liveness verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Liveness analysis enables register allocation and optimization
- Proper liveness analysis ensures correct variable liveness tracking
- Liveness analysis support enables Runa compilation for optimized register allocation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Liveness analysis and variable liveness computation
- Live range analysis and live variable tracking
- Liveness optimization and liveness-based analysis
- Liveness validation and liveness verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement liveness analysis functionality
