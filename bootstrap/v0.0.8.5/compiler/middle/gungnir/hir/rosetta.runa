Note:
This file handles cross-language translation and Rosetta Stone functionality.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process cross-language translation and language interoperability
- Handle C to HIR translation and HIR to C translation
- Manage Python to HIR translation and HIR to Python translation
- Process language-specific feature mapping and semantic preservation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Cross-language translation enables universal language interoperability
- Proper translation handling ensures correct cross-language code generation
- Rosetta Stone support enables Runa compilation for multi-language ecosystems

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Cross-language translation and language interoperability
- C to HIR translation and HIR to C translation
- Python to HIR translation and HIR to Python translation
- Language-specific feature mapping and semantic preservation
