Note:
This file handles Runa annotation system processing and AI intent annotation management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Runa annotation system parsing and annotation block processing
- Handle structured annotation validation and annotation consistency checking
- Manage annotation inference and annotation generation for AI systems
- Process annotation verification and annotation system management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Runa annotation system enables structured AI intent communication and machine-parseable directives
- Proper annotation handling ensures correct AI agent interaction and code reasoning
- RunaAnnotate support enables Runa compilation for AI-enhanced development workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Runa annotation system parsing and annotation block processing
- Structured annotation validation and annotation consistency checking
- Annotation inference and annotation generation for AI systems
- Annotation verification and annotation system management
