Note:
This file handles compiler-specific system calls and compiler system interface for the compiler backend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process compiler system call generation and compiler system call optimization
- Handle compiler system interface and compiler system call management
- Manage compiler system call validation and compiler system call verification
- Process compiler system call performance and compiler system call utilities

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Compiler system calls are fundamental to compiler operation and system integration
- Proper compiler system call handling ensures correct compiler system interface and platform integration
- Compiler system call utilities support compiler operation, system integration, and platform-specific functionality

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Compiler system call generation and compiler system call optimization
- Compiler system interface and compiler system call management
- Compiler system call validation and compiler system call verification
- Compiler system call performance and compiler system call utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement compiler syscalls functionality
