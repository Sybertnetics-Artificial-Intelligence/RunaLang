Note:
This file handles FreeBSD ARM64 system calls and platform-specific system interface for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process FreeBSD ARM64 system call generation and system call optimization
- Handle FreeBSD ARM64 system interface and system call management
- Manage FreeBSD ARM64 system call validation and system call verification
- Process FreeBSD ARM64 system call performance and system call utilities

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- FreeBSD ARM64 system calls are fundamental to FreeBSD ARM64 system integration
- Proper system call handling ensures correct system interface and platform integration
- System call utilities support system integration, platform-specific operations, and system interface

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- FreeBSD ARM64 system call generation and system call optimization
- FreeBSD ARM64 system interface and system call management
- FreeBSD ARM64 system call validation and system call verification
- FreeBSD ARM64 system call performance and system call utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement FreeBSD ARM64 syscalls functionality
