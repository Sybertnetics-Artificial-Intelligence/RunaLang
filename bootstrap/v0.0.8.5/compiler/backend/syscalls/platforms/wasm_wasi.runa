This file implements WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) syscalls for WebAssembly targets.

WASI SYSCOLLS - WebAssembly System Interface Implementation
- Process WASI syscall definitions and WASI syscall management for WebAssembly targets
- Handle WASI syscall resolution and WASI syscall optimization for WebAssembly execution
- Manage WASI syscall validation and WASI syscall verification for WebAssembly security
- Process WASI syscall performance and WASI syscall efficiency for WebAssembly runtime

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- WASI syscalls enable WebAssembly programs to interact with the host system
- Proper WASI syscall handling ensures correct WebAssembly execution and system integration
- WASI syscall support enables Runa compilation for WebAssembly targets with full system access

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- WASI syscall definitions and WASI syscall management for WebAssembly targets
- WASI syscall resolution and WASI syscall optimization for WebAssembly execution
- WASI syscall validation and WASI syscall verification for WebAssembly security
- WASI syscall performance and WASI syscall efficiency for WebAssembly runtime

Dependencies:
- Imports platform_interface.runa for syscall interface definitions
- Imports wasm_encoder.runa for WebAssembly bytecode generation
- Imports wasm_optimizer.runa for WebAssembly optimization
