Note:
This file handles MIPS system calls and platform-specific system interface for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process MIPS system call generation and system call optimization
- Handle MIPS system interface and system call management
- Manage MIPS system call validation and system call verification
- Process MIPS system call performance and system call utilities

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- MIPS system calls are fundamental to MIPS system integration
- Proper system call handling ensures correct system interface and platform integration
- System call utilities support system integration, platform-specific operations, and system interface

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- MIPS system call generation and system call optimization
- MIPS system interface and system call management
- MIPS system call validation and system call verification
- MIPS system call performance and system call utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement MIPS syscalls functionality
