Note:
This file handles speculation points and speculative optimization for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process speculation point identification and speculation optimization
- Handle speculation validation and speculation recovery operations
- Manage speculation optimization and speculation performance utilities
- Process speculation monitoring and speculation analysis operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Speculation points are fundamental to advanced optimization and performance enhancement
- Proper speculation handling ensures efficient speculative optimization and recovery mechanisms
- Speculation utilities support advanced optimization, performance enhancement, and optimization recovery

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Speculation point identification and speculation optimization
- Speculation validation and speculation recovery operations
- Speculation optimization and speculation performance utilities
- Speculation monitoring and speculation analysis operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement speculation points functionality
