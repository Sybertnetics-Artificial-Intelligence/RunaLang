Note:
This file handles AOT (Ahead-of-Time) bytecode generation and bytecode optimization for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process AOT bytecode generation and bytecode compilation
- Handle bytecode optimization and bytecode performance utilities
- Manage bytecode validation and bytecode verification operations
- Process bytecode metadata and bytecode analysis operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- AOT bytecode generation is fundamental to compiler output and runtime performance
- Proper bytecode handling ensures efficient code generation and optimized execution
- Bytecode utilities support ahead-of-time compilation, optimization, and code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- AOT bytecode generation and bytecode compilation
- Bytecode optimization and bytecode performance utilities
- Bytecode validation and bytecode verification operations
- Bytecode metadata and bytecode analysis operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement AOT bytecode functionality
