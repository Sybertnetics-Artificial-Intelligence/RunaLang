Note:
This file handles tier transitions and multi-tier compilation for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process tier transition management and tier compilation coordination
- Handle tier optimization and tier performance utilities
- Manage tier validation and tier verification operations
- Process tier monitoring and tier analysis operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Tier transitions are fundamental to multi-tier compilation and adaptive optimization
- Proper tier handling ensures efficient compilation tiers and adaptive optimization strategies
- Tier utilities support multi-tier compilation, adaptive optimization, and performance scaling

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Tier transition management and tier compilation coordination
- Tier optimization and tier performance utilities
- Tier validation and tier verification operations
- Tier monitoring and tier analysis operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement tier transitions functionality
