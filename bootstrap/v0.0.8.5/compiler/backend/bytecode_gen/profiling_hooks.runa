Note:
This file handles profiling hooks and runtime profiling support for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process profiling hook generation and profiling instrumentation
- Handle profiling data collection and profiling analysis operations
- Manage profiling optimization and profiling performance utilities
- Process profiling validation and profiling verification operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Profiling hooks are fundamental to runtime performance analysis and optimization
- Proper profiling handling ensures effective performance monitoring and optimization guidance
- Profiling utilities support runtime profiling, performance analysis, and optimization feedback

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Profiling hook generation and profiling instrumentation
- Profiling data collection and profiling analysis operations
- Profiling optimization and profiling performance utilities
- Profiling validation and profiling verification operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement profiling hooks functionality
