Note:
This file handles deoptimization metadata and deoptimization support for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process deoptimization metadata generation and deoptimization tracking
- Handle deoptimization triggers and deoptimization recovery operations
- Manage deoptimization optimization and deoptimization performance utilities
- Process deoptimization validation and deoptimization verification operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Deoptimization metadata is fundamental to runtime optimization and performance monitoring
- Proper deoptimization handling ensures efficient runtime optimization and fallback mechanisms
- Deoptimization utilities support runtime optimization, performance monitoring, and optimization recovery

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Deoptimization metadata generation and deoptimization tracking
- Deoptimization triggers and deoptimization recovery operations
- Deoptimization optimization and deoptimization performance utilities
- Deoptimization validation and deoptimization verification operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement deoptimization metadata functionality
