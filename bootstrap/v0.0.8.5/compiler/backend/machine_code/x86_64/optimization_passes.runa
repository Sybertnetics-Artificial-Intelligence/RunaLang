Note:
This file handles x86_64 optimization passes and code optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process x86_64 optimization passes and code optimization
- Handle x86_64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Manage x86_64 register optimization and register allocation optimization
- Process x86_64 performance optimization and code performance optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- x86_64 optimization enables high-performance x86_64 code generation
- Proper optimization handling ensures optimal x86_64 code performance
- x86_64 optimization support enables Runa compilation for high-performance x86_64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- x86_64 optimization passes and code optimization
- x86_64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- x86_64 register optimization and register allocation optimization
- x86_64 performance optimization and code performance optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement x86_64 optimization passes functionality
