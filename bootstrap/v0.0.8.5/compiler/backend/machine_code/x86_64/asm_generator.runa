Note:
This file handles x86_64 assembly code generation and assembly output.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process x86_64 assembly code generation and assembly output formatting
- Handle x86_64 assembly optimization and assembly code optimization
- Manage x86_64 assembly validation and assembly code verification
- Process x86_64 assembly debugging and assembly code debugging

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- x86_64 assembly generation enables native x86_64 code output
- Proper assembly handling ensures correct and efficient x86_64 code generation
- x86_64 support enables Runa compilation for x86_64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- x86_64 assembly code generation and assembly output formatting
- x86_64 assembly optimization and assembly code optimization
- x86_64 assembly validation and assembly code verification
- x86_64 assembly debugging and assembly code debugging
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement x86_64 assembly generator functionality
