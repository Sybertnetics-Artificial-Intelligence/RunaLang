Note:
This file handles x86_64 register allocation and register management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process x86_64 register allocation and register management
- Handle x86_64 register constraints and register usage optimization
- Manage x86_64 register spilling and register optimization
- Process x86_64 register-based operations and register optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- x86_64 register management is crucial for efficient x86_64 code generation
- Proper register handling ensures optimal x86_64 CPU resource utilization
- x86_64 support enables Runa compilation for x86_64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- x86_64 register allocation and register management
- x86_64 register constraints and register usage optimization
- x86_64 register spilling and register optimization
- x86_64 register-based operations and register optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement x86_64 register allocator functionality
