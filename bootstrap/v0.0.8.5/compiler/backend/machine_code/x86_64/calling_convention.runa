Note:
This file handles x86_64 calling convention and function call interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process x86_64 calling convention rules and parameter passing
- Handle x86_64-specific register usage and register allocation
- Manage x86_64 stack frame management and stack operations
- Process x86_64 function call optimization and call interface

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- x86_64 calling convention ensures correct function calls on x86_64 systems
- Proper calling convention handling enables system integration and library compatibility
- x86_64 support enables Runa compilation for x86_64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- x86_64 calling convention processing and parameter passing
- x86_64 register usage and register allocation
- x86_64 stack frame management and stack operations
- x86_64 function call optimization and call interface
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement x86_64 calling convention functionality
