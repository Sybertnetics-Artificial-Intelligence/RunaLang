This file handles x86 register allocation and register management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process x86 register allocation and register management
- Handle x86 register constraints and register usage optimization
- Manage x86 register spilling and register optimization
- Process x86 register-based operations and register optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- x86 register management is crucial for efficient x86 code generation
- Proper register handling ensures optimal x86 CPU resource utilization
- x86 support enables Runa compilation for x86 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- x86 register allocation and register management
- x86 register constraints and register usage optimization
- x86 register spilling and register optimization
- x86 register-based operations and register optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement x86 register allocator functionality
