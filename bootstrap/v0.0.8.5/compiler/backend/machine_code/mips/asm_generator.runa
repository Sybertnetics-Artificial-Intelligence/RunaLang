Note:
This file handles MIPS assembly code generation and assembly output.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process MIPS assembly code generation and assembly output formatting
- Handle MIPS assembly optimization and assembly code optimization
- Manage MIPS assembly validation and assembly code verification
- Process MIPS assembly debugging and assembly code debugging

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- MIPS assembly generation enables native MIPS code output
- Proper assembly handling ensures correct and efficient MIPS code generation
- MIPS support enables Runa compilation for MIPS platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- MIPS assembly code generation and assembly output formatting
- MIPS assembly optimization and assembly code optimization
- MIPS assembly validation and assembly code verification
- MIPS assembly debugging and assembly code debugging
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement MIPS assembly generator functionality
