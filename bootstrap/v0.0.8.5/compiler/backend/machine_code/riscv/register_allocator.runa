Note:
This file handles RISC-V register allocation and register management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process RISC-V register allocation and register management
- Handle RISC-V register constraints and register usage optimization
- Manage RISC-V register spilling and register optimization
- Process RISC-V register-based operations and register optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- RISC-V register management is crucial for efficient RISC-V code generation
- Proper register handling ensures optimal RISC-V CPU resource utilization
- RISC-V support enables Runa compilation for RISC-V platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- RISC-V register allocation and register management
- RISC-V register constraints and register usage optimization
- RISC-V register spilling and register optimization
- RISC-V register-based operations and register optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement RISC-V register allocator functionality
