Note:
This file handles RISC-V instruction encoding and instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process RISC-V instruction encoding and instruction generation
- Handle RISC-V instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Manage RISC-V instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- Process RISC-V instruction validation and instruction verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- RISC-V instruction processing enables native RISC-V code generation
- Proper instruction handling ensures correct and efficient RISC-V code
- RISC-V support enables Runa compilation for RISC-V platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- RISC-V instruction encoding and instruction generation
- RISC-V instruction optimization and instruction selection
- RISC-V instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- RISC-V instruction validation and instruction verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement RISC-V instruction encoder functionality
