Note:
This file handles AArch64 NEON vectorization and SIMD optimization.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process AArch64 NEON vectorization and SIMD instruction generation
- Handle AArch64 NEON optimization and vector operation optimization
- Manage AArch64 NEON register allocation and vector register management
- Process AArch64 NEON instruction selection and vector instruction selection

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- AArch64 NEON vectorization enables high-performance SIMD operations
- Proper NEON handling ensures optimal AArch64 vector code generation
- AArch64 NEON support enables Runa compilation for high-performance AArch64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- AArch64 NEON vectorization and SIMD instruction generation
- AArch64 NEON optimization and vector operation optimization
- AArch64 NEON register allocation and vector register management
- AArch64 NEON instruction selection and vector instruction selection
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement AArch64 NEON vectorizer functionality
