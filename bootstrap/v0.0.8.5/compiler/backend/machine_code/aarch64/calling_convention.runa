Note:
This file handles AArch64 calling convention and function call interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process AArch64 calling convention rules and parameter passing
- Handle AArch64-specific register usage and register allocation
- Manage AArch64 stack frame management and stack operations
- Process AArch64 function call optimization and call interface

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- AArch64 calling convention ensures correct function calls on AArch64 systems
- Proper calling convention handling enables system integration and library compatibility
- AArch64 support enables Runa compilation for AArch64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- AArch64 calling convention processing and parameter passing
- AArch64 register usage and register allocation
- AArch64 stack frame management and stack operations
- AArch64 function call optimization and call interface
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement AArch64 calling convention functionality
