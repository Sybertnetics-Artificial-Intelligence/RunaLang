Note:
This file handles machine code interface and architecture abstraction.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process machine code interface and architecture abstraction
- Handle machine code generation and machine code output
- Manage machine code optimization and machine code optimization
- Process machine code validation and machine code verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Machine code interface enables architecture-agnostic machine code generation
- Proper machine code interface ensures correct machine code generation across architectures
- Machine code interface support enables Runa compilation for multiple architectures

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Machine code interface and architecture abstraction
- Machine code generation and machine code output
- Machine code optimization and machine code optimization
- Machine code validation and machine code verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement machine code interface functionality
