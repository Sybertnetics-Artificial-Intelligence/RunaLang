Note:
This file handles ARM32 instruction encoding and instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process ARM32 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- Handle ARM32 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Manage ARM32 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- Process ARM32 instruction validation and instruction verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- ARM32 instruction processing enables native ARM32 code generation
- Proper instruction handling ensures correct and efficient ARM32 code
- ARM32 support enables Runa compilation for ARM32 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- ARM32 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- ARM32 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- ARM32 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- ARM32 instruction validation and instruction verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement ARM32 instruction encoder functionality
