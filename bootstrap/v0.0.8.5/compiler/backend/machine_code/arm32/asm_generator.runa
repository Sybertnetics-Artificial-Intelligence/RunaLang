Note:
This file handles ARM32 assembly code generation and assembly output.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process ARM32 assembly code generation and assembly output formatting
- Handle ARM32 assembly optimization and assembly code optimization
- Manage ARM32 assembly validation and assembly code verification
- Process ARM32 assembly debugging and assembly code debugging

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- ARM32 assembly generation enables native ARM32 code output
- Proper assembly handling ensures correct and efficient ARM32 code generation
- ARM32 support enables Runa compilation for ARM32 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- ARM32 assembly code generation and assembly output formatting
- ARM32 assembly optimization and assembly code optimization
- ARM32 assembly validation and assembly code verification
- ARM32 assembly debugging and assembly code debugging
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement ARM32 assembly generator functionality
