This file handles ARM32 register allocation and register management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process ARM32 register allocation and register management
- Handle ARM32 register constraints and register usage optimization
- Manage ARM32 register spilling and register optimization
- Process ARM32 register-based operations and register optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- ARM32 register management is crucial for efficient ARM32 code generation
- Proper register handling ensures optimal ARM32 CPU resource utilization
- ARM32 support enables Runa compilation for ARM32 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- ARM32 register allocation and register management
- ARM32 register constraints and register usage optimization
- ARM32 register spilling and register optimization
- ARM32 register-based operations and register optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement ARM32 register allocator functionality
