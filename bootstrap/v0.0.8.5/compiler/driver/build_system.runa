Note:
This file handles build system orchestration and build process management for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process build configuration and build system setup
- Handle build target management and build process orchestration
- Manage build optimization and build performance utilities
- Process build validation and build process monitoring

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Build system orchestration is fundamental to compiler operation and project compilation
- Proper build handling ensures efficient compilation process and build management
- Build system utilities support project compilation, dependency resolution, and build optimization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Build configuration and build system setup
- Build target management and build process orchestration
- Build optimization and build performance utilities
- Build validation and build process monitoring
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement build system functionality
