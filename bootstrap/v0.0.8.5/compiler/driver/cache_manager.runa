This file handles compilation cache management and cache optimization for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process cache storage and cache retrieval operations
- Handle cache invalidation and cache consistency management
- Manage cache optimization and cache performance utilities
- Process cache validation and cache monitoring operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Cache management is fundamental to incremental compilation and build performance
- Proper cache handling ensures efficient compilation and faster subsequent builds
- Cache utilities support incremental builds, dependency tracking, and build optimization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Cache storage and cache retrieval operations
- Cache invalidation and cache consistency management
- Cache optimization and cache performance utilities
- Cache validation and cache monitoring operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement cache manager functionality
