Note:
This file handles incremental build management and incremental compilation for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process incremental compilation and change detection operations
- Handle incremental build optimization and build performance utilities
- Manage incremental validation and incremental consistency management
- Process incremental monitoring and incremental analysis operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Incremental build management is fundamental to fast compilation and development efficiency
- Proper incremental handling ensures efficient compilation and faster development cycles
- Incremental utilities support change detection, selective compilation, and build optimization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Incremental compilation and change detection operations
- Incremental build optimization and build performance utilities
- Incremental validation and incremental consistency management
- Incremental monitoring and incremental analysis operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement incremental build functionality
