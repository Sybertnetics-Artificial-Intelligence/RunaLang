Note:
This file handles target platform management and cross-compilation support for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process target platform management and platform-specific configuration
- Handle cross-compilation support and target platform selection
- Manage target-specific optimization flags and platform feature detection
- Process target validation and target compatibility management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Target platform management is fundamental to cross-compilation and platform-specific optimization
- Proper target handling ensures correct code generation for different architectures and platforms
- Target utilities support cross-compilation, platform-specific features, and optimization targeting

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Target platform management and platform-specific configuration
- Cross-compilation support and target platform selection
- Target-specific optimization flags and platform feature detection
- Target validation and target compatibility management
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement target manager functionality
