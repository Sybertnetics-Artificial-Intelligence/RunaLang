Note:
This file handles linking process coordination and executable generation for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process linking process coordination and library resolution
- Handle symbol resolution and symbol relocation operations
- Manage executable generation and linking optimization
- Process linking validation and linking verification operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Linking process coordination is fundamental to executable generation and library integration
- Proper linking handling ensures correct executable creation and symbol resolution
- Linking utilities support library linking, symbol resolution, and executable generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Linking process coordination and library resolution
- Symbol resolution and symbol relocation operations
- Executable generation and linking optimization
- Linking validation and linking verification operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement linker driver functionality
