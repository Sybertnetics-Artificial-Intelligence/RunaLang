Note:
This file handles parallel compilation and concurrent compilation process management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process parallel compilation orchestration and concurrent process management
- Handle parallel optimization and parallel performance utilities
- Manage parallel synchronization and parallel consistency management
- Process parallel monitoring and parallel analysis operations

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Parallel compilation is fundamental to fast compilation and multi-core utilization
- Proper parallel handling ensures efficient compilation and optimal resource utilization
- Parallel utilities support concurrent compilation, thread management, and build optimization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Parallel compilation orchestration and concurrent process management
- Parallel optimization and parallel performance utilities
- Parallel synchronization and parallel consistency management
- Parallel monitoring and parallel analysis operations
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement parallel compilation functionality
