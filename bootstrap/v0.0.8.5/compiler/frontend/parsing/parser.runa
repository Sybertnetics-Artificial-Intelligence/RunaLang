Note:
This file contains the main parser implementation for Runa source code.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Coordinate parsing of Runa source code into Abstract Syntax Trees
- Manage parsing state and token stream processing
- Handle parsing errors and recovery strategies
- Provide the primary interface for syntax analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- The parser is the core of the syntax analysis phase
- Proper parsing enables accurate AST construction and semantic analysis
- Parser coordination ensures consistent syntax analysis across all language features

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Main parser orchestration and syntax analysis
- Token stream processing and parsing state management
- Integration with specialized parsing components
- AST construction and parsing error handling
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement main parser functionality
