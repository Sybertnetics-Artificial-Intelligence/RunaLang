Note:
This file contains the main parser implementation for Runa source code.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Coordinate parsing of Runa source code into Abstract Syntax Trees
- Manage parsing state and token stream processing
- Handle parsing errors and recovery strategies
- Provide the primary interface for syntax analysis
- Support ownership tracking for v0.0.8.5 memory safety

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- The parser is the core of the syntax analysis phase
- Proper parsing enables accurate AST construction and semantic analysis
- Parser coordination ensures consistent syntax analysis across all language features
- Ownership tracking integration enables memory safety analysis

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Main parser orchestration and syntax analysis
- Token stream processing and parsing state management
- Integration with specialized parsing components
- AST construction and parsing error handling
- Ownership tracking state management for v0.0.8.5

Dependencies:
- Imports lexical/lexer.runa for tokenization
- Imports lexical/token_stream.runa for token navigation
- Imports ast.runa for AST node creation
- Imports all parsing components (expression_parsers, statement_parsers, etc.)
- Imports memory/layout.runa for structure allocation
