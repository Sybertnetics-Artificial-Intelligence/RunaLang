Note:
This file defines Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node types and structures for Runa.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Define all AST node types for Runa language constructs
- Provide AST node data structures and type definitions
- Handle AST node relationships and hierarchy
- Manage AST node metadata and attribute storage
- Support ownership tracking for v0.0.8.5 memory safety

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- AST node definitions are the foundation of the parsing system
- Proper AST structure enables accurate representation of Runa code
- AST node types support all language features and constructs
- Ownership tracking nodes enable memory safety analysis

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- AST node type definitions and data structures
- AST node relationship and hierarchy management
- AST node metadata and attribute handling
- AST node validation and consistency checking
- Ownership tracking node support for v0.0.8.5

Dependencies:
- Imports memory/layout.runa for structure allocation
- Imports collections/list.runa for child node management
- Imports core/string_core.runa for string operations
