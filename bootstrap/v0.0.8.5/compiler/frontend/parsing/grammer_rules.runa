Note:
This file defines grammar rules and parsing rules for the Runa language.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Define grammar rules for all Runa language constructs
- Handle grammar rule precedence and associativity
- Process grammar rule validation and consistency checking
- Manage grammar rule expansion and derivation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Grammar rules define the formal syntax of the Runa language
- Proper grammar definition enables accurate parsing and validation
- Grammar rules support all language features and constructs

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Grammar rule definitions and syntax specifications
- Grammar rule precedence and associativity management
- Grammar validation and consistency checking
- Grammar rule expansion and derivation utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement grammar rules and parsing rules functionality
