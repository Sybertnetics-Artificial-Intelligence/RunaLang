Note:
This file handles parsing error recovery and continuation strategies.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Implement parsing error recovery strategies and heuristics
- Handle parsing failures and attempt recovery continuation
- Process syntax errors and provide recovery suggestions
- Manage parsing state during error recovery

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Error recovery enables continued parsing despite syntax errors
- Parsing recovery improves user experience by providing helpful error suggestions
- Recovery strategies help users understand and fix syntax issues

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Parsing error detection and classification
- Recovery strategy selection and execution
- Parsing state management during recovery
- Error recovery continuation and validation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement parsing error recovery functionality
