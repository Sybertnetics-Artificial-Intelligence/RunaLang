Note:
This file handles operator precedence and associativity for Runa expressions.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Define precedence levels for all Runa operators
- Implement precedence comparison and associativity rules
- Support both Developer Mode symbols and Canon Mode natural language
- Handle ternary operator precedence for v0.0.8.5
- Provide precedence validation and error detection

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Correct precedence handling ensures proper expression evaluation
- Precedence rules must match Runa language specification
- Both symbol and natural language operators need precedence support
- Ternary operator has special precedence rules in v0.0.8.5
- Precedence validation catches syntax errors early

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Operator precedence level definitions
- Precedence comparison and validation
- Associativity rule enforcement
- Ternary operator precedence handling (v0.0.8.5)
- Precedence error detection and reporting

Dependencies:
- Imports lexical/math_symbols.runa for mathematical operator types
- Imports lexical/operators.runa for general operator types
- Imports memory/layout.runa for structure allocation
- Imports collections/hashtable.runa for operator lookup
