Note:
This file manages operator precedence and associativity for expression parsing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Define operator precedence levels and associativity rules
- Handle precedence resolution during expression parsing
- Process precedence conflicts and precedence disambiguation
- Manage precedence context and precedence validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Operator precedence ensures correct expression evaluation order
- Proper precedence handling enables accurate expression parsing
- Precedence rules are fundamental to mathematical and logical expressions

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Operator precedence level definitions and management
- Precedence resolution and conflict handling
- Associativity rule processing and validation
- Precedence context management and disambiguation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement precedence management functionality
