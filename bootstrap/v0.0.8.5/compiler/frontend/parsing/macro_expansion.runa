Note:
This file handles macro expansion and metaprogramming features in Runa.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process macro definitions and macro invocations
- Handle macro expansion and code generation
- Manage macro scope and macro resolution
- Process metaprogramming constructs and code transformation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Macro expansion enables powerful metaprogramming capabilities
- Proper macro handling supports code generation and transformation
- Macro processing is essential for advanced Runa language features

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Macro definition parsing and validation
- Macro expansion and code generation
- Macro scope management and resolution
- Metaprogramming construct processing
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement macro expansion functionality
