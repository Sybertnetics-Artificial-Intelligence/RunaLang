Note:
This file handles parsing of annotations and metadata in Runa source code.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Parse annotation syntax and metadata declarations
- Handle annotation parameters and attribute processing
- Process annotation validation and semantic analysis
- Manage annotation context and scope resolution

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Annotations provide metadata and compiler directives for Runa code
- Proper annotation parsing enables advanced language features and optimizations
- Annotation processing is required for documentation and tooling support

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Annotation syntax parsing and validation
- Annotation parameter processing and attribute handling
- Annotation context management and scope resolution
- Annotation semantic analysis and validation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement annotation parser functionality
