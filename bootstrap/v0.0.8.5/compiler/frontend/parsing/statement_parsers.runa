Note:
This file implements statement parsing for Runa language statements.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Parse control flow statements (If, Otherwise, While, For)
- Handle variable declaration and assignment statements
- Process function and process definition statements
- Handle ownership tracking and move semantics - v0.0.8.5 feature

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Statement parsing is fundamental to Runa's control flow and program structure
- Ownership tracking is a key v0.0.8.5 feature for memory safety
- Proper statement parsing enables correct program analysis and code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Control flow statement parsing and validation
- Variable declaration and assignment statement processing
- Function and process definition parsing
- Ownership tracking statement parsing and validation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement statement parsing functionality, including ownership tracking for v0.0.8.5
