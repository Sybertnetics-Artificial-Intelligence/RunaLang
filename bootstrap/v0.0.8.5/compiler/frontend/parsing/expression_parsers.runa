Note:
This file implements expression parsing for Runa language expressions.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Parse arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions
- Handle ternary operator parsing (condition ? true_value : false_value) - v0.0.8.5 feature
- Process function calls and method invocations
- Handle expression precedence and associativity

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Expression parsing is fundamental to Runa's computational capabilities
- Ternary operator is a key v0.0.8.5 feature requirement
- Proper expression parsing enables correct evaluation and code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Arithmetic and logical expression parsing
- Ternary operator parsing and validation
- Function call and method invocation parsing
- Expression precedence and associativity handling
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement expression parsing functionality, including ternary operator for v0.0.8.5
