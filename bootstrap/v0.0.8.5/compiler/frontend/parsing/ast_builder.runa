Note:
This file provides high-level AST building functions for Runa parsing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Provide convenient functions for building common AST node patterns
- Handle AST node relationships and hierarchy construction
- Manage complex AST node creation with proper child relationships
- Support ownership tracking integration for v0.0.8.5
- Provide validation for AST node construction

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Simplifies AST construction throughout the parser
- Ensures consistent AST node structure and relationships
- Provides reusable patterns for common language constructs
- Enables proper ownership tracking integration
- Reduces code duplication in parsing components

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- High-level AST building functions for common patterns
- AST node relationship and hierarchy management
- Complex AST node construction with validation
- Ownership tracking integration for v0.0.8.5
- AST node validation and consistency checking

Dependencies:
- Imports ast.runa for AST node definitions and basic operations
- Imports memory/layout.runa for structure allocation
- Imports collections/list.runa for child node management
- Imports core/string_core.runa for string operations

    Note:   ownership_info - Pointer to OwnershipInfo structure
    Note: 
    Note: Returns:
    Note:   1 on success, 0 on failure
    Note: 
    Note: Side Effects:
    Note:   - Sets node.ownership_info to provided ownership_info
    Note:   - Enables ownership tracking for the node
    Note: 
    Note: TODO: Implement using:
    Note: - AST.ast_node_set_ownership_info for integration

Process called "validate_ast_construction" takes node as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Validate that an AST node is properly constructed
    Note: 
    Note: Parameters:
    Note:   node - Pointer to AST node to validate
    Note: 
    Note: Returns:
    Note:   1 if node is valid, 0 if invalid
    Note: 
    Note: Validation checks:
    Note:   - Node is not null
    Note:   - Node type is valid for its structure
    Note:   - Required children are present
    Note:   - Child relationships are consistent
    Note:   - Ownership tracking is valid (if present)
    Note: 
    Note: TODO: Implement comprehensive validation logic
    
    Return 1  Note: Placeholder - assume valid
End Process

Process called "fix_ast_relationships" takes node as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Fix any inconsistencies in AST node relationships
    Note: 
    Note: Parameters:
    Note:   node - Pointer to AST node to fix
    Note: 
    Note: Returns:
    Note:   1 on success, 0 on failure
    Note: 
    Note: Fixes:
    Note:   - Ensures parent-child relationships are bidirectional
    Note:   - Validates child count matches children list size
    Note:   - Fixes ownership tracking references
    Note: 
    Note: TODO: Implement relationship fixing logic
    
    Return 1  Note: Placeholder
End Process

Process called "ast_node_debug_info" takes node as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Get debug information for an AST node
    Note: 
    Note: Parameters:
    Note:   node - Pointer to AST node
    Note: 
    Note: Returns:
    Note:   Pointer to debug information string
    Note:   Returns 0 on failure
    Note: 
    Note: Debug info includes:
    Note:   - Node type and position
    Note:   - Value and value type
    Note:   - Child count and relationships
    Note:   - Ownership tracking status
    Note: 
    Note: TODO: Implement debug information generation
    
    Return 0  Note: Placeholder
