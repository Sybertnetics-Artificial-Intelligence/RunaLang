Note:
This file implements the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) builder for constructing parse trees.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Build AST nodes from parsed tokens and grammar rules
- Construct hierarchical AST structures representing Runa code
- Handle AST node creation and relationship management
- Provide AST manipulation and transformation utilities

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- AST construction is fundamental to the parsing process
- Proper AST building enables accurate semantic analysis and code generation
- AST manipulation utilities support compiler optimizations and transformations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- AST node creation and construction
- AST hierarchy management and relationship handling
- AST manipulation and transformation utilities
- AST validation and consistency checking
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement AST builder functionality
