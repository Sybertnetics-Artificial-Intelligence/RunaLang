This file implements intelligent error suggestion and fix recommendation engine.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Analyze errors and provide intelligent fix suggestions with memory-efficient operations
- Generate context-aware error corrections and recommendations with arena-based temporary analysis

- Integrate with intentional recovery for smart error handling with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Intelligent suggestions improve developer productivity and learning
- Context-aware recommendations help developers understand and fix issues
- Automatic fix suggestions reduce debugging time and improve user experience
- Memory-efficient suggestion generation enables scalable diagnostics

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Error analysis and suggestion generation with ownership patterns
- Context-aware fix recommendation algorithms with arena-based operations
- Common error pattern recognition and correction with memory safety
- Integration with recovery systems for intelligent error handling with deterministic cleanup
