Note:
This file handles source map generation and management for debugging and error reporting.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Generate source maps for compiled code to enable debugging with memory-efficient operations
- Map compiled code positions back to original source locations with arena-based temporary analysis
- Handle source map encoding and decoding for debugging tools with ownership-aware operations
- Provide source location tracking for error reporting with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Source maps enable debugging of compiled Runa code
- Source location mapping improves error reporting accuracy
- Source map support is essential for modern development tools integration
- Memory-efficient source mapping enables scalable debugging support

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Source map generation and encoding with ownership patterns
- Source location mapping and tracking with arena-based operations
- Source map decoding and debugging support with memory safety
- Source location utilities for error reporting with deterministic cleanup
