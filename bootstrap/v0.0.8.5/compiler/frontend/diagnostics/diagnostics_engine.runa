Note:
This file implements the core diagnostics engine for error reporting and analysis.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Coordinate error collection and reporting across all compiler phases with memory-efficient operations
- Manage diagnostic severity levels and categorization with arena-based temporary analysis
- Provide unified diagnostic interface for all compiler components with ownership-aware operations
- Handle diagnostic filtering and output formatting with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Centralized diagnostics ensure consistent error reporting across the compiler
- Unified diagnostic interface simplifies error handling in all phases
- Diagnostic coordination enables comprehensive error analysis and reporting
- Memory-efficient diagnostics enable scalable compilation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Diagnostic collection and management with ownership patterns
- Error severity classification and filtering with arena-based operations
- Diagnostic output coordination and formatting with memory safety
- Cross-phase diagnostic integration and reporting with deterministic cleanup
