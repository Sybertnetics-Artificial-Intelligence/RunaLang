Note:
This file defines error types, error codes, and error handling structures.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Define all compiler error types and error codes
- Provide error classification and categorization
- Handle error data structures and error context
- Manage error severity levels and error reporting

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Standardized error types ensure consistent error handling across the compiler
- Error codes enable programmatic error handling and recovery
- Error classification helps developers understand and categorize issues

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Error type definitions and error code management
- Error classification and severity level handling
- Error data structures and context management
- Error reporting and error handling utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement error definitions and error handling functionality
