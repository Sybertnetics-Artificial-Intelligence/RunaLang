Note:
This file defines error types, error codes, and error handling structures.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Define all compiler error types and error codes with comprehensive classification
- Provide error classification and categorization with severity levels
- Handle error data structures and error context with memory-efficient operations
- Manage error severity levels and error reporting with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Standardized error types ensure consistent error handling across the compiler
- Error codes enable programmatic error handling and recovery
- Error classification helps developers understand and categorize issues
- Memory-efficient error handling enables scalable diagnostics

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Error type definitions and error code management with ownership patterns
- Error classification and severity level handling with arena-based operations
- Error data structures and context management with memory safety
- Error reporting and error handling utilities with deterministic cleanup
