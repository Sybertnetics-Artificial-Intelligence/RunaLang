Note:
This file manages error context and diagnostic information for intentional recovery.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Track error context and diagnostic information during parsing with memory-efficient operations
- Maintain error state and recovery context across parsing phases with arena-based temporary analysis
- Provide error context for intelligent recovery strategies with ownership-aware operations
- Handle error propagation and context preservation with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Error context enables intelligent error recovery and suggestions
- Proper error tracking improves user experience and debugging
- Context preservation allows for accurate error reporting and recovery
- Memory-efficient context management enables scalable recovery operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Error context tracking and management with ownership patterns
- Diagnostic information collection and preservation with arena-based operations
- Error state management and propagation with memory safety
- Context-aware error reporting and recovery with deterministic cleanup
