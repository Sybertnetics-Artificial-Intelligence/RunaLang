Note:
This file implements the core intentional recovery engine for parsing errors.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Implement intelligent error recovery strategies during parsing with memory-efficient operations
- Coordinate between syntactic and semantic recovery mechanisms with arena-based temporary analysis
- Manage recovery state and decision making with ownership-aware operations
- Provide recovery suggestions and automatic fixes with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Intentional recovery improves user experience by providing helpful error suggestions
- Intelligent recovery enables continued parsing despite syntax errors
- Recovery engine coordinates multiple recovery strategies for optimal results
- Memory-efficient recovery enables scalable parsing operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Recovery strategy selection and execution with ownership patterns
- Recovery state management and coordination with arena-based operations
- Automatic fix suggestion and application with memory safety
- Recovery quality assessment and validation with deterministic cleanup
