Note:
This file implements the core intentional recovery engine for parsing errors.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Implement intelligent error recovery strategies during parsing
- Coordinate between syntactic and semantic recovery mechanisms
- Manage recovery state and decision making
- Provide recovery suggestions and automatic fixes

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Intentional recovery improves user experience by providing helpful error suggestions
- Intelligent recovery enables continued parsing despite syntax errors
- Recovery engine coordinates multiple recovery strategies for optimal results

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Recovery strategy selection and execution
- Recovery state management and coordination
- Automatic fix suggestion and application
- Recovery quality assessment and validation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement intentional recovery engine functionality
