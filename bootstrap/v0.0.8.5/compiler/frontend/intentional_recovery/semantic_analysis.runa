Note:
This file handles semantic analysis for intentional recovery and error correction.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Perform semantic analysis to understand intended meaning despite syntax errors
- Analyze context and provide semantic-based recovery suggestions
- Handle type inference and semantic validation during recovery
- Process semantic errors and provide intelligent corrections

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Semantic analysis enables understanding of programmer intent despite syntax errors
- Semantic-based recovery provides more accurate error corrections
- Context-aware analysis improves recovery quality and user experience

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Semantic analysis and context understanding
- Type inference and validation during recovery
- Semantic error detection and correction
- Context-aware recovery suggestion generation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement semantic analysis functionality for intentional recovery
