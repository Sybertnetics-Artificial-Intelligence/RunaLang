Note:
This file handles semantic analysis for intentional recovery and error correction.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Perform semantic analysis to understand intended meaning despite syntax errors with memory-efficient operations
- Analyze context and provide semantic-based recovery suggestions with arena-based temporary analysis
- Handle type inference and semantic validation during recovery with ownership-aware operations
- Process semantic errors and provide intelligent corrections with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Semantic analysis enables understanding of programmer intent despite syntax errors
- Semantic-based recovery provides more accurate error corrections
- Context-aware analysis improves recovery quality and user experience
- Memory-efficient semantic analysis enables scalable recovery operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Semantic analysis and context understanding with ownership patterns
- Type inference and validation during recovery with arena-based operations
- Semantic error detection and correction with memory safety
- Context-aware recovery suggestion generation with deterministic cleanup
