Note:
This file handles syntactic recovery strategies for parsing errors.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Implement syntactic error recovery strategies and heuristics with memory-efficient operations
- Handle common syntax errors and provide automatic corrections with arena-based temporary analysis
- Process parsing failures and attempt recovery continuation with ownership-aware operations
- Manage syntactic error state and recovery decision making with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Syntactic recovery enables continued parsing despite syntax errors
- Automatic syntax correction improves user experience and productivity
- Recovery strategies help users understand and fix syntax issues
- Memory-efficient recovery enables scalable parsing operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Syntactic error detection and classification with ownership patterns
- Recovery strategy selection and execution with arena-based operations
- Automatic syntax correction and suggestion with memory safety
- Parsing continuation after recovery with deterministic cleanup
