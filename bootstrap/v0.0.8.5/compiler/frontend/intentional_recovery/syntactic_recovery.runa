Note:
This file handles syntactic recovery strategies for parsing errors.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Implement syntactic error recovery strategies and heuristics
- Handle common syntax errors and provide automatic corrections
- Process parsing failures and attempt recovery continuation
- Manage syntactic error state and recovery decision making

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Syntactic recovery enables continued parsing despite syntax errors
- Automatic syntax correction improves user experience and productivity
- Recovery strategies help users understand and fix syntax issues

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Syntactic error detection and classification
- Recovery strategy selection and execution
- Automatic syntax correction and suggestion
- Parsing continuation after recovery
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement syntactic recovery functionality
