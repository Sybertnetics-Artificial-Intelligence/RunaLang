Note:
This file handles syntactic recovery strategies for parsing errors.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Implement syntactic error recovery strategies and heuristics with memory-efficient operations
- Handle common syntax errors and provide automatic corrections with arena-based temporary analysis
- Process parsing failures and attempt recovery continuation with ownership-aware operations
- Manage syntactic error state and recovery decision making with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Syntactic recovery enables continued parsing despite syntax errors
- Automatic syntax correction improves user experience and productivity
- Recovery strategies help users understand and fix syntax issues
- Memory-efficient recovery enables scalable parsing operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Syntactic error detection and classification with ownership patterns
- Recovery strategy selection and execution with arena-based operations
- Automatic syntax correction and suggestion with memory safety
- Parsing continuation after recovery with deterministic cleanup

Process called "syntactic_recovery_learn_from_feedback" takes engine as Integer, recovery_id as Integer, was_successful as Integer, arena as Integer returns Nothing:
    Note:
    Learns from recovery feedback to improve strategies using arena-based operations.

    Parameters:
    - engine: OWNED SyntacticRecoveryEngine reference
    - recovery_id: Recovery ID to learn from (STACK)
    - was_successful: Whether recovery was successful (STACK)
    - arena: Arena for temporary learning operations (ARENA)

    Side Effects:
    - Uses ARENA for temporary learning operations
    - Updates strategy success rates
    - Improves future recoveries

    Algorithm:
    1. Use ARENA for temporary learning operations
    2. Update strategy success rates
    3. Adjust strategy priorities
    4. Update learning algorithms
    5. ARENA data freed automatically
