Note:
This file handles general operator recognition and processing in Runa.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Recognize assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
- Process ternary operator (condition ? true_value : false_value) - v0.0.8.5 feature
- Handle member access operators (., ->)
- Process function call operators (())

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Operators are fundamental to Runa's expression and statement syntax
- Ternary operator is a key v0.0.8.5 feature requirement
- Proper operator handling enables correct expression evaluation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Assignment operator recognition and tokenization
- Ternary operator parsing and validation
- Member access and function call operator handling
- Operator precedence and associativity management
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement operator recognition functionality, including ternary operator for v0.0.8.5
