Note:
This file handles delimiter recognition and processing in the Runa lexer.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Recognize and tokenize bracket delimiters (parentheses, braces, square brackets)
- Handle nested delimiter structures and matching validation
- Track delimiter depth and nesting levels for syntax validation
- Process delimiter-related syntax errors and recovery
- Support delimiter context tracking for expression parsing

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Delimiters are fundamental to Runa's syntax structure and expression grouping
- Proper delimiter handling is required for correct parsing of complex expressions
- Delimiter matching is crucial for syntax error detection and recovery
- Nesting depth tracking enables better error messages and IDE features

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Delimiter recognition and tokenization functions
- Nesting depth tracking and validation
- Delimiter matching and error detection
- Syntax recovery for mismatched delimiters
- Context-aware delimiter processing

Dependencies:
- Imports collections/stack.runa for delimiter nesting stack
- Imports memory/layout.runa for Token structure allocation
