Note:
This file handles literal value recognition and tokenization in Runa.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Recognize and tokenize string literals (single and double quoted)
- Process numeric literals (integers, floats, scientific notation)
- Handle boolean literals (true, false)
- Process character literals and escape sequences

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Literals are fundamental data types in Runa programs
- Proper literal handling ensures correct value representation
- Literal tokenization is required for accurate semantic analysis

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- String literal parsing and escape sequence handling
- Numeric literal recognition and validation
- Boolean and character literal processing
- Literal value validation and type inference
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement literal recognition and tokenization functionality
