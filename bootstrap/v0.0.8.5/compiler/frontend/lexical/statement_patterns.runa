Note:
This file recognizes and validates statement patterns in Runa.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Recognize variable declaration patterns (Let, Define, Set)
- Identify control flow statement patterns (If, Match, For, While)
- Track ownership transfer patterns for v0.0.8.5
- Validate statement structure and completeness
- Detect common statement errors and provide recovery

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Statement patterns define Runa's natural language syntax structure
- Proper pattern recognition enables accurate parsing and AST construction
- Ownership tracking is critical for memory safety in v0.0.8.5
- Pattern validation catches syntax errors early in compilation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Statement pattern matching and recognition
- Variable ownership and borrow tracking for v0.0.8.5
- Statement structure validation
- Error detection and recovery for malformed statements
- Context-sensitive statement analysis

Dependencies:
- Imports keywords.runa for keyword recognition
- Imports operators.runa for operator context
- Imports memory/layout.runa for Token and structure allocation
