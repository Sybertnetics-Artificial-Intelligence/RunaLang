Note:
This file handles statement pattern recognition and ownership tracking in Runa.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Recognize control flow statements (If, Otherwise, While, For)
- Process variable declaration patterns (Let, Set)
- Handle ownership tracking patterns and move semantics - v0.0.8.5 feature
- Process function and process definition patterns

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Statement patterns are fundamental to Runa's control flow syntax
- Ownership tracking is a key v0.0.8.5 feature for memory safety
- Pattern recognition enables proper statement parsing and validation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Control flow statement pattern recognition
- Variable declaration and assignment pattern handling
- Ownership tracking pattern recognition and validation
- Function and process definition pattern processing
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement statement pattern recognition functionality, including ownership tracking for v0.0.8.5
