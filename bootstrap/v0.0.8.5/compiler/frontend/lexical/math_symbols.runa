Note:
This file handles mathematical symbols and operators in Runa.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Recognize mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, %, **)
- Process comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Handle logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Process bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Mathematical symbols are core to Runa's expression syntax
- Proper operator recognition enables correct expression parsing
- Mathematical operators are fundamental to programming logic

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Mathematical operator recognition and tokenization
- Operator precedence and associativity handling
- Multi-character operator processing (==, !=, <=, >=)
- Operator context validation and error detection
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement mathematical symbol recognition functionality
