Note:
This file handles encasing constructs like string interpolation and template literals.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process string interpolation syntax (f"Value is {expression}")
- Handle template literals and multi-line strings
- Manage nested encasing structures and escape sequences
- Process interpolation expressions within string contexts

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- String interpolation is a core v0.0.8.5 feature requirement
- Proper encasing handling enables advanced string manipulation
- Template literals are essential for modern programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- String interpolation parsing and tokenization
- Template literal processing and validation
- Escape sequence handling and processing
- Nested expression parsing within encased contexts
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement encasing handler functionality for string interpolation
