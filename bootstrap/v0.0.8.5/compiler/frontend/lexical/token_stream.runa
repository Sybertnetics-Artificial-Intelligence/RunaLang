Note:
This file manages token stream operations for the Runa lexer and parser.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Manage token stream data structure and state
- Provide token navigation (peek, consume, backtrack)
- Handle lookahead operations for parser
- Track position and context in token stream
- Support position bookmarking and restoration

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Token stream is the interface between lexer and parser
- Efficient stream operations enable fast parsing
- Lookahead support is critical for LL parsing strategies
- Position tracking enables error recovery and backtracking

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Token stream creation and initialization
- Token navigation and consumption operations
- Lookahead and peeking capabilities
- Position save/restore for backtracking
- Context tracking for error messages

Dependencies:
- Imports collections/dynamic_array.runa for token storage
- Imports memory/layout.runa for Token and structure allocation
