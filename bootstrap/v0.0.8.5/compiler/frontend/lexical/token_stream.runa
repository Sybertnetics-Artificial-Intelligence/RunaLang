Note:
This file manages token streams and provides token stream operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Manage token stream creation and manipulation
- Provide token lookahead and backtracking capabilities
- Handle token stream position tracking and navigation
- Process token stream filtering and transformation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Token streams are the interface between lexer and parser
- Proper token stream management enables efficient parsing
- Token stream operations support complex parsing algorithms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Token stream creation and initialization
- Token lookahead and peek operations
- Token stream position tracking and navigation
- Token stream filtering and transformation utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement token stream management functionality
