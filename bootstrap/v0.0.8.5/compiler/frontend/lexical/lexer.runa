Note:
This file implements the main Runa lexer orchestration logic.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Orchestrate all lexical analysis components
- Manage lexer state (position, line, column, mode)
- Route characters to appropriate recognizers
- Handle whitespace, comments, and indentation
- Produce token stream for parser consumption
- Manage error reporting and recovery

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Lexer is the entry point for source code tokenization
- Proper orchestration ensures all token types are recognized
- State management is critical for accurate position tracking
- Error handling enables helpful diagnostic messages
- Integration point for all lexical components

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Lexer state management and initialization
- Character-by-character source scanning
- Token type determination and dispatch
- Whitespace and comment processing
- Indentation-based scoping (INDENT/DEDENT tokens)
- Error token generation and recovery
- Token stream construction

Dependencies:
- Imports ALL lexical components (literals, keywords, operators, etc.)
- Imports core/string_core.runa for string operations
- Imports core/memory_core.runa for memory management
- Imports memory/layout.runa for structure allocation
