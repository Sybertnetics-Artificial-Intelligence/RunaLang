Note:
This file contains the main lexer implementation for tokenizing Runa source code.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Tokenize Runa source code into a stream of tokens
- Coordinate with specialized lexical components (keywords, operators, literals)
- Handle lexical analysis state and position tracking
- Provide the primary interface for lexical analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- The lexer is the foundation of the compilation pipeline
- Proper tokenization is required for all subsequent parsing phases
- Lexer coordination ensures consistent token stream generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Main lexer orchestration and tokenization logic
- Source code position tracking and state management
- Integration with specialized lexical components
- Token stream generation and error handling
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement main lexer functionality
