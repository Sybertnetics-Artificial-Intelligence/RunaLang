Note:
This file provides lexer creation, configuration, and factory functionality.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Create and configure lexer instances with appropriate settings
- Manage lexer state and configuration parameters
- Provide lexer factory methods for different parsing contexts
- Handle lexer initialization and cleanup

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Lexer factory enables flexible lexer configuration for different use cases
- Proper lexer creation ensures consistent tokenization across the compiler
- Factory pattern allows for easy testing and mock lexer creation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Lexer factory methods and configuration
- Lexer state management and initialization
- Context-specific lexer creation and setup
- Lexer lifecycle management and cleanup
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement lexer factory functionality
