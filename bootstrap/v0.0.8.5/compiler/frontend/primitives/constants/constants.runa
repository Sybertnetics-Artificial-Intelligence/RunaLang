Note:
This file defines and manages compile-time constants and constant values.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Define compile-time constant values and constant expressions
- Handle constant evaluation and constant folding
- Process constant propagation and constant optimization
- Manage constant storage and constant resolution

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Constants enable compile-time optimization and constant folding
- Proper constant handling improves runtime performance
- Constant evaluation ensures correct constant expression processing

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Constant definition and constant value management
- Constant evaluation and constant folding algorithms
- Constant propagation and constant optimization
- Constant storage and constant resolution utilities
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement constants functionality
