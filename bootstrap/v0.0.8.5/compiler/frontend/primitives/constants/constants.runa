Note:
This file handles constant expression validation and analysis for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Validate constant expressions and constant declarations
- Analyze constant folding opportunities
- Detect compile-time evaluable expressions
- Validate constant propagation rules

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Constant expressions must be evaluable at compile time
- Constant folding improves performance
- Constant propagation enables optimization
- Constant validation ensures correctness

Dependencies:
- NONE (pure analysis and validation)
