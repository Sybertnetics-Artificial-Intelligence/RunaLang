Note:
This file handles null value processing and null type management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process null values and null type handling
- Handle null validation and null safety checking
- Manage null representation and null storage
- Process null optimization and null constant folding

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Null values are fundamental to optional and nullable types in Runa
- Proper null handling ensures null safety and prevents null pointer errors
- Null processing is required for accurate type checking and memory safety

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Null value processing and null type handling
- Null validation and null safety checking
- Null representation and null storage management
- Null optimization and null constant folding
