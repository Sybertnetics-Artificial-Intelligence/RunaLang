Note:
This file handles literal value processing and literal type management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process literal values and literal type inference
- Handle literal validation and literal conversion
- Manage literal storage and literal representation
- Process literal optimization and literal constant folding

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Literals are fundamental data values in Runa programs
- Proper literal handling ensures correct value representation and type inference
- Literal processing is required for accurate semantic analysis and code generation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Literal value processing and type inference
- Literal validation and conversion handling
- Literal storage and representation management
- Literal optimization and constant folding
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement literal functionality
