HYBRID ARCHITECTURE: Inline Assembly Parsing and Validation

This file handles inline assembly with a hybrid approach:
- SHARED LOGIC: Platform-agnostic parsing of syntax structure
- DELEGATED VALIDATION: Platform-specific instruction validation

Architecture:
- This file parses "Inline Assembly:" ... "End Assembly" blocks
- Extracts individual assembly lines and operands
- Delegates instruction validation to platform/{platform}/instructions.runa
- Platform-specific files validate instruction names, operands, and encoding

Example:
```runa
Inline Assembly:
    movq %rax, %rbx
    addq $5, %rcx
End Assembly
```

Parser (this file): Extracts "movq", "%rax, %rbx", "addq", "$5, %rcx"
Validator (platform): Checks if "movq" and "addq" are valid x86_64 instructions

Supported platforms:
- x86_64: Intel/AMD instruction set
- ARM64: ARM AArch64 instruction set
- MIPS, RISC-V, PowerPC, etc.

Usage:
Call parse_inline_assembly() with Runa code containing inline assembly blocks.
The platform-specific validator is automatically selected at compile time.

Process called "parse_inline_assembly" takes code_ptr as Integer returns Integer:

    Note: Returns pointer to parsed assembly structure, or 0 on error

    Note: ARCHITECTURE:
    Note: 1. Find "Inline Assembly:" marker
    Note: 2. Extract lines until "End Assembly"
    Note: 3. For each line, extract instruction and operands
    Note: 4. Delegate to PlatformInstructions.validate_instruction()
    Note: 5. Build AST node for inline assembly block

    Return 0  Note: Placeholder - implementation needed

Process called "extract_assembly_block" takes code_ptr as Integer, start_offset as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Extract assembly lines between markers
    Note: Platform-agnostic: just extracts text

    Return 0  Note: Placeholder

Process called "parse_assembly_line" takes line_ptr as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Parse single assembly line into instruction + operands
    Note: Platform-agnostic: splits on whitespace and commas

Process called "validate_operand" takes operand_ptr as Integer, instruction_type as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Validate if operand is valid for instruction type
    Note: Delegates to platform-specific implementation
    Note: Examples: register names, immediate values, memory addresses
    Return PlatformInstructions.validate_operand(operand_ptr, instruction_type)

Process called "get_instruction_encoding" takes instruction_ptr as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Get binary encoding information for instruction
