Note:
This file handles inline assembly parsing and validation for low-level operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Parse inline assembly syntax and validate assembly instructions
- Handle assembly operand parsing and register allocation
- Process assembly constraints and clobber specifications
- Manage assembly integration with Runa code generation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Inline assembly enables low-level system programming and performance optimization
- Proper assembly parsing ensures correct code generation and system integration
- Assembly support is essential for system-level Runa applications

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Inline assembly syntax parsing and validation
- Assembly operand processing and register management
- Assembly constraint handling and clobber specification
- Assembly code generation and integration
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement inline assembly functionality
