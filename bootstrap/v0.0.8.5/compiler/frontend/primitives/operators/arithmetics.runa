Note:
This file handles arithmetic operator processing and arithmetic expression evaluation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **)
- Handle arithmetic operator precedence and associativity
- Manage arithmetic type promotion and arithmetic conversion
- Process arithmetic optimization and arithmetic constant folding

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Arithmetic operators are fundamental to mathematical computation in Runa
- Proper arithmetic handling ensures correct mathematical expression evaluation
- Arithmetic optimization improves runtime performance for mathematical operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Arithmetic operator processing and arithmetic expression evaluation
- Arithmetic operator precedence and associativity handling
- Arithmetic type promotion and arithmetic conversion processing
- Arithmetic optimization and arithmetic constant folding
