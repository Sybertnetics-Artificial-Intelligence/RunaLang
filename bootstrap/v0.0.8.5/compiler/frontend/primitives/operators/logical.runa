Note:
This file handles logical operator processing and logical expression evaluation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Handle logical operator precedence and associativity
- Manage logical type handling and logical conversion
- Process logical optimization and logical constant folding

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Logical operators are fundamental to boolean logic and conditional programming
- Proper logical handling ensures correct logical expression evaluation
- Logical optimization improves performance for logical operations and short-circuit evaluation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Logical operator processing and logical expression evaluation
- Logical operator precedence and associativity handling
- Logical type handling and logical conversion processing
- Logical optimization and logical constant folding
