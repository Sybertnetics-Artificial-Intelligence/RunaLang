Note:
This file handles bitwise operator processing and bitwise expression evaluation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
- Handle bitwise operator precedence and associativity
- Manage bitwise type handling and bitwise conversion
- Process bitwise optimization and bitwise constant folding

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Bitwise operators are fundamental to low-level programming and system operations
- Proper bitwise handling enables efficient bit manipulation and system programming
- Bitwise optimization improves performance for bit-level operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Bitwise operator processing and bitwise expression evaluation
- Bitwise operator precedence and associativity handling
- Bitwise type handling and bitwise conversion processing
- Bitwise optimization and bitwise constant folding
