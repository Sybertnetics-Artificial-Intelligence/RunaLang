Note:
This file handles comparison operator processing and comparison expression evaluation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Handle comparison operator precedence and associativity
- Manage comparison type handling and comparison conversion
- Process comparison optimization and comparison constant folding

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Comparison operators are fundamental to conditional logic and decision making
- Proper comparison handling ensures correct relational expression evaluation
- Comparison optimization improves performance for conditional operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Comparison operator processing and comparison expression evaluation
- Comparison operator precedence and associativity handling
- Comparison type handling and comparison conversion processing
- Comparison optimization and comparison constant folding
