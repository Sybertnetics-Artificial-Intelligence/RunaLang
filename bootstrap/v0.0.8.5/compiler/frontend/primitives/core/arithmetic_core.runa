Note:
This file handles arithmetic operations and arithmetic instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Handle arithmetic overflow and underflow detection
- Manage arithmetic optimization and arithmetic constant folding
- Process arithmetic type promotion and arithmetic conversion

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Arithmetic operations are fundamental to computational programming
- Proper arithmetic handling ensures correct mathematical computation
- Arithmetic optimization improves runtime performance and reduces computation overhead

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Arithmetic operation processing and arithmetic instruction handling
- Arithmetic overflow and underflow detection and handling
- Arithmetic optimization and arithmetic constant folding
- Arithmetic type promotion and arithmetic conversion processing
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement arithmetic core functionality
