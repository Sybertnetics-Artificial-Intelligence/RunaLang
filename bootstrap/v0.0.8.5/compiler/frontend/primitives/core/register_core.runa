Note:
This file handles CPU register operations and register management primitives.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process register operations and register allocation
- Handle register optimization and register spilling
- Manage register constraints and register usage optimization
- Process register-based operations and register optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Register operations are fundamental to efficient code generation and execution
- Proper register handling ensures optimal CPU resource utilization
- Register optimization improves runtime performance and reduces memory access

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Register operation processing and register allocation
- Register optimization and register spilling algorithms
- Register constraint handling and register usage optimization
- Register-based operations and register optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement register core functionality
