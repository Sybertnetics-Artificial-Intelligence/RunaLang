Note:
This file handles bitwise operations and bit manipulation primitives.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shift operations)
- Handle bit manipulation and bit field operations
- Manage bitwise optimization and bitwise constant folding
- Process bitwise type handling and bitwise conversion

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Bitwise operations are fundamental to low-level programming and system operations
- Proper bitwise handling enables efficient bit manipulation and system programming
- Bitwise optimization improves performance for bit-level operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Bitwise operation processing and bit manipulation handling
- Bit field operations and bit manipulation primitives
- Bitwise optimization and bitwise constant folding
- Bitwise type handling and bitwise conversion processing
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement bitwise core functionality
