Note:
This file handles stack operations and stack management primitives.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process stack operations (push, pop, stack frame management)
- Handle stack optimization and stack usage optimization
- Manage stack safety and stack overflow detection
- Process stack-based operations and stack optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Stack operations are fundamental to function calls and local variable management
- Proper stack handling ensures correct function execution and memory management
- Stack optimization improves runtime performance and reduces stack usage

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Stack operation processing and stack frame management
- Stack optimization and stack usage optimization
- Stack safety checking and stack overflow detection
- Stack-based operations and stack optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement stack core functionality
