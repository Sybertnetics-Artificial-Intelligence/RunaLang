Note: - Indexed by upper 7 bits of normalized remainder and divisor
Note: - Divisor must be normalized: 0.5 <= d < 1.0 (in binary: 1.xxx...)
Note: - Remainder range: |r| < d

Note: Convergence guarantee: With proper digit selection, |r_next| <= (2/3)*d

    Note: Now extract upper 112 bits from NORMALIZED result

    Note: Step 8: Round ONCE with proper IEEE 754 round-to-nearest-ties-to-even
    Note: This is the ONLY rounding operation in the entire FMA
    Note: Must extract guard (G), round (R), and sticky (S) bits from 224-bit result
    
    Note: IEEE 754 rounding requires THREE bits beyond the mantissa:
    Note: - Guard bit (G): first bit after mantissa
    Note: - Round bit (R): second bit after mantissa
    Note: - Sticky bit (S): OR of all remaining bits
    
    Note: Rounding rules for round-to-nearest-ties-to-even:
    Note: - If G=0: truncate (round down)
    Note: - If G=1 and (R=1 or S=1): round up (above midpoint)
    Note: - If G=1 and R=0 and S=0: exact tie → round to even (check LSB)

    Note: Guard bit  = bit 111 of 224-bit result
    Note: Round bit  = bit 110 of 224-bit result

    Note: Bit 110: This is bit 46 of result_mid
    Note: Bits [109:96]: These are bits [45:32] of result_mid
    Note: Bits [95:32]: These are bits [63:0] of result_low
    Note: Wait, need to recalculate based on extraction

    Note: Actually, we need to think about this more carefully
    Note: After normalization, result is 224 bits: [result_high:64][result_mid:64][result_low:64]
    Note: But result_high is only 64 bits with MSB at position 63 (the leading 1)
    Note: Total: bit 223 is at result_high[63], bit 160 is at result_high[0]
    Note:        bit 159 is at result_mid[63], bit 96 is at result_mid[0]
    Note:        bit 95 is at result_low[63], bit 32 is at result_low[0]
    
    Note: We extract final mantissa as: proc right_shift from BitwiseCore with result_high, 1 + proc left_shift from BitwiseCore with result_mid, 63...
    Note: This gives us bits [223:112]
    
    Note: Remaining bits for rounding: [111:0]
    Note: Bit 111 is at result_mid bit 47 (159 - 112 = 47)
    Note: Bit 110 is at result_mid bit 46
    Note: Bits [109:96] are at result_mid bits [45:32]
    Note: Bits [95:0] are split: [95:32] in result_low[63:0] (but we need all of it)

    Note: Extract Guard bit (bit 111 = bit 47 of result_mid after normalization)
    Let guard_bit be proc bitwise_and from BitwiseCore with proc right_shift from BitwiseCore with result_mid, 47, 1

    Note: Check if any bit in result_low is set
