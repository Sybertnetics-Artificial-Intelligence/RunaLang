Note:
This file handles logical operations and logical instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, short-circuit evaluation)
- Handle logical optimization and logical constant folding
- Manage logical type handling and logical conversion
- Process logical result processing and logical optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Logical operations are fundamental to boolean logic and conditional programming
- Proper logical handling ensures correct logical computation and control flow
- Logical optimization improves performance for logical operations and short-circuit evaluation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Logical operation processing and logical instruction handling
- Logical optimization and logical constant folding
- Logical type handling and logical conversion processing
- Logical result processing and logical optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement logical core functionality
