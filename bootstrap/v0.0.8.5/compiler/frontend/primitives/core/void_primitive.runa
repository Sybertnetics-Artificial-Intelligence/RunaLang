Note:
This file handles void primitive type and void operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process void values and void type handling
- Handle void operations and void function returns
- Manage void optimization and void constant folding
- Process void type validation and void type checking

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Void primitives are fundamental to functions that don't return values
- Proper void handling ensures correct function return type validation
- Void processing is required for accurate type checking and function validation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Void value processing and void type handling
- Void operations and void function return handling
- Void optimization and void constant folding
- Void type validation and void type checking

Dependencies:
- NONE (void is a type marker, not a runtime value)

Note: ============================================================================

Note: Void is a special type that indicates "no value". It is used for:
Note: 1. Functions that don't return a value (procedures)
Note: 2. Pointer to void (generic pointer, like C's void*)

Note: There is no runtime representation of void - it's purely a compile-time
Note: type system concept.
Note: ============================================================================

Note: Void has no runtime functions because it represents absence of value.
Note: This file exists primarily for documentation and future extensions.

Note: Future: Void Type System Integration
Note: ============================================================================

Note: When the type system is enhanced, void will be used for:

Note: 1. Procedure declarations (no return value):
Note:    Process called "print_message" takes msg as String returns Void:
Note:        display(msg)
Note:    End Process

Note: 2. Generic pointers:
Note:    Let ptr as Pointer to Void be allocate(100)
Note:    Note: Can be cast to any other pointer type

Note: 3. Type safety:
Note:    Note: Compiler error if trying to use void value in expression
Note:    Let x be print_message("hello")  # ERROR: void has no value
