Note:
This file handles void primitive type and void operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process void values and void type handling
- Handle void operations and void function returns
- Manage void optimization and void constant folding
- Process void type validation and void type checking

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Void primitives are fundamental to functions that don't return values
- Proper void handling ensures correct function return type validation
- Void processing is required for accurate type checking and function validation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Void value processing and void type handling
- Void operations and void function return handling
- Void optimization and void constant folding
- Void type validation and void type checking
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement void primitive functionality
