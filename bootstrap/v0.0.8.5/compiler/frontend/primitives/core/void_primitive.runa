Note:
This file handles void primitive type and void operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process void values and void type handling
- Handle void operations and void function returns
- Manage void optimization and void constant folding
- Process void type validation and void type checking

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Void primitives are fundamental to functions that don't return values
- Proper void handling ensures correct function return type validation
- Void processing is required for accurate type checking and function validation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Void value processing and void type handling
- Void operations and void function return handling
- Void optimization and void constant folding
- Void type validation and void type checking

Dependencies:
- NONE (void is a type marker, not a runtime value)

Note: ============================================================================
Note: Void Type Definition (Native Type)
Note: ============================================================================

Note: Void is a special type that indicates "no value". It is used for:
Note: 1. Functions that don't return a value (procedures)
Note: 2. Pointer to void (generic pointer, similar to C's void*)

Note: There is no runtime representation of void - it's purely a compile-time
Note: type system concept.
Note: ============================================================================

Type Called "Void":
    Note: Void type represents absence of a value
    Note: Used for procedures that don't return anything
    Note: Cannot be instantiated or stored in variables

    Note: Compiler implementation:
    Note: - Size: 0 bytes (no runtime representation)
    Note: - Alignment: N/A (cannot be stored)
    Note: - Purpose: Compile-time type checking only

    Note: Type checking rules:
    Note: - Functions returning Void cannot have their result assigned
    Note: - Void values cannot be used in expressions
    Note: - Void* (pointer to void) is allowed for generic pointers
End Type

Note: ============================================================================
Note: Void Pointer Type (Generic Pointer)
Note: ============================================================================

Note: Pointer to Void is a special pointer type that can point to any type.
Note: This provides type erasure for generic data structures and APIs.

Note: Usage Examples:
Note: 1. Generic allocation:
Note:    Let generic_ptr as Pointer to Void be proc allocate from Layout with 100
Note:    Note: Can be cast to any specific pointer type later

Note: 2. Generic data structures:
Note:    Process called "store_generic" takes ptr as Pointer to Void returns Void:
Note:        Note: Store any type of pointer
Note:    End Process

Note: 3. Type casting (explicit):
Note:    Let int_ptr as Pointer to Integer be cast_ptr_to_int(generic_ptr)

Note: Safety Note: Void pointers bypass type checking - use with caution!

Process called "is_void_type" takes type_id as Integer returns Boolean:
    Note: Check if a type is Void
    Note: Used by compiler for type checking
    Note: type_id is the compiler's internal type identifier

    Let VOID_TYPE_ID be 0  Note: Void has type ID 0 by convention
    If type_id is equal to VOID_TYPE_ID:
        Return true
    End If

End Process

Process called "validate_void_usage" takes context as Integer returns Boolean:
    Note: Validate that void is used correctly
    Note: context: 0=return type, 1=pointer target, 2=variable type

    Note: Valid usages:
    Note: - context 0: return type (procedure)
    Note: - context 1: pointer target (void*)

    Note: Invalid usage:
    Note: - context 2: variable type (cannot have void variables)

    If context is equal to 0:
        Return true  Note: Valid as return type
    End If
    If context is equal to 1:
        Return true  Note: Valid as pointer target (void*)
    End If
    If context is equal to 2:
        Return false  Note: Invalid as variable type
    End If

    Return false  Note: Unknown context, invalid
