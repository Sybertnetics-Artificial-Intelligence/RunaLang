Note:
This file handles boolean primitive type and boolean operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process boolean values and boolean type handling
- Handle boolean operations and boolean logic processing
- Manage boolean optimization and boolean constant folding
- Process boolean conversion and boolean type promotion

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Boolean primitives are fundamental to logical programming and control flow
- Proper boolean handling ensures correct logical computation and decision making
- Boolean optimization improves performance for logical operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Boolean value processing and boolean type handling
- Boolean operations and boolean logic processing
- Boolean optimization and boolean constant folding
- Boolean conversion and boolean type promotion
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement boolean primitive functionality
