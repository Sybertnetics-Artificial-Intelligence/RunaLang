Note:
This file handles comparison operations and comparison instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process comparison operations (equal, not equal, less than, greater than, etc.)
- Handle comparison optimization and comparison constant folding
- Manage comparison type handling and comparison conversion
- Process comparison result processing and comparison optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Comparison operations are fundamental to conditional logic and decision making
- Proper comparison handling ensures correct relational computation
- Comparison optimization improves performance for conditional operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Comparison operation processing and comparison instruction handling
- Comparison optimization and comparison constant folding
- Comparison type handling and comparison conversion processing
- Comparison result processing and comparison optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement comparison core functionality
