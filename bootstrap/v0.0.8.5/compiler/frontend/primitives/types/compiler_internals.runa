Note:
This file handles compiler internal types and compiler-specific type operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process compiler internal types and compiler-specific type handling
- Handle compiler type metadata and compiler type information
- Manage compiler type optimization and compiler type processing
- Process compiler type validation and compiler type checking

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Compiler internal types are fundamental to compiler operation and type system
- Proper compiler type handling ensures correct compiler operation and type processing
- Compiler types support advanced compiler features and optimizations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Compiler internal type processing and compiler-specific type handling
- Compiler type metadata and compiler type information management
- Compiler type optimization and compiler type processing
- Compiler type validation and compiler type checking
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement compiler internals functionality
