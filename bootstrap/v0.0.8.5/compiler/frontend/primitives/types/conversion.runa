Note:
This file handles type conversion and type transformation operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process type conversion and type transformation operations
- Handle type coercion and type casting operations
- Manage type conversion optimization and type transformation optimization
- Process type conversion validation and type transformation validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Type conversion is fundamental to type system and type compatibility
- Proper type conversion ensures correct type transformation and type compatibility
- Type conversion supports type system flexibility and type interoperability

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Type conversion and type transformation operations
- Type coercion and type casting operations
- Type conversion optimization and type transformation optimization
- Type conversion validation and type transformation validation
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement type conversion functionality
