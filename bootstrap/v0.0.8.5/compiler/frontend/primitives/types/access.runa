Note:
This file handles type field access and member access operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process field access operations and member access operations
- Handle struct field access and type member access
- Manage field offset calculation and field access optimization
- Process field access validation and member access validation

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Field access is fundamental to object-oriented programming and struct manipulation
- Proper field access ensures correct member access and type member operations
- Field access optimization improves performance for struct and object operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Field access operations and member access operations
- Struct field access and type member access
- Field offset calculation and field access optimization
- Field access validation and member access validation
