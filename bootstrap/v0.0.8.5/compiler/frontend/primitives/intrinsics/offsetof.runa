Note:
This file handles the offsetof intrinsic for field offset queries.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process offsetof intrinsic calls and field offset queries
- Handle offset calculation and field offset information retrieval
- Manage offset optimization and offset-aware code generation
- Process offset validation and offset constraint checking

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- offsetof intrinsic enables compile-time field offset queries and optimization
- Proper offset handling ensures correct memory layout and field access
- Offset intrinsics support low-level programming and memory management

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- offsetof intrinsic processing and field offset queries
- Offset calculation and field offset information retrieval
- Offset optimization and offset-aware code generation
- Offset validation and offset constraint checking
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement offsetof intrinsic functionality
