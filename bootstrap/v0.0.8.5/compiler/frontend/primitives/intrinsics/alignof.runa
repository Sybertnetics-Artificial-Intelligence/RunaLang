Note:
This file provides the alignof intrinsic - returns alignment requirements for types.

Alignment is the number of bytes a type must be aligned to in memory.
For example:
- byte: 1-byte alignment
- int32: 4-byte alignment
- int64/pointer: 8-byte alignment
- struct: alignment of largest field

This is used for:
- Struct layout calculations
- Memory allocation alignment
- Performance optimization

Depends on: NOTHING (returns compile-time constants)

Process called "get_type_alignment" takes type_name as String returns Integer:
    Note: Get alignment requirement for a type
    Note: Returns alignment in bytes (must be power of 2)

    Note: Basic integer types
    If string_equals(type_name, "Integer") is equal to 1:
        Return 8  Note: 64-bit integer

        Return 1
    End If

    If string_equals(type_name, "Byte") is equal to 1:
        Return 1

    Note: Pointer types - always 8 bytes on x86_64
    If string_equals(type_name, "Pointer") is equal to 1:
        Return 8

    If string_equals(type_name, "String") is equal to 1:

    Note: Floating point types
    If string_equals(type_name, "Float") is equal to 1:
        Return 4

        Return 8
    End If

    Note: Boolean type
    If string_equals(type_name, "Boolean") is equal to 1:
        Return 1
    End If

    Note: Character type
    If string_equals(type_name, "Character") is equal to 1:
        Return 1
    End If

    Note: Default alignment for unknown types
    Note: Use 8-byte alignment as safe default for x86_64
    Return 8

Note: ============================================================================

Process called "calculate_struct_alignment" takes field_alignments as Integer, field_count as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Calculate struct alignment (max of all field alignments)
    Note: field_alignments: pointer to array of integers
    Note: field_count: number of fields
    Note: Returns: alignment for the entire struct

    If field_count is less than or equal to 0:
        Return 8  Note: Default alignment
    End If

    Let max_alignment be 1
    Let i be 0

    While i is less than field_count:
        Note: Get alignment at index i (each alignment is 8 bytes as Integer)
        Let offset be i multiplied by 8
        Let field_alignment be memory_get_int64(field_alignments, offset)

        If field_alignment is greater than max_alignment:
