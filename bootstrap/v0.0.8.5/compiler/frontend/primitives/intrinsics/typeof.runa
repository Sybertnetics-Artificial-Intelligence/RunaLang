Note:
This file handles the typeof intrinsic for type information queries.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process typeof intrinsic calls and type information queries
- Handle type information retrieval and type metadata access
- Manage type optimization and type-aware code generation
- Process type validation and type constraint checking

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- typeof intrinsic enables compile-time type information queries and optimization
- Proper type handling ensures correct type checking and type management
- Type intrinsics support advanced type system features and metaprogramming

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- typeof intrinsic processing and type information queries
- Type information retrieval and type metadata access
- Type optimization and type-aware code generation
- Type validation and type constraint checking
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement typeof intrinsic functionality
