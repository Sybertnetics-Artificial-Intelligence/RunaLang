Note:
This file handles builtin call processing and builtin function management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process builtin call expressions and builtin function calls
- Handle builtin type mapping and builtin function resolution
- Manage builtin argument passing and builtin return value processing
- Process builtin optimization and builtin constant folding

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Builtin calls are fundamental to language runtime and system operations
- Proper builtin handling ensures correct builtin function invocation and execution
- Builtin optimization improves performance for builtin operations and system calls

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Builtin call processing and builtin function calls
- Builtin type mapping and builtin function resolution
- Builtin argument passing and builtin return value processing
- Builtin optimization and builtin constant folding
