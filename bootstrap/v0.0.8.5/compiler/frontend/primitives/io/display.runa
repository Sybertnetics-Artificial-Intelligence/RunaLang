DISPLAY STATEMENT IMPLEMENTATION - stdout Output System
==============================================================================

This module implements the Display statement for stdout output, providing
Python-print-level functionality with natural language syntax.

SYNTAX SUPPORTED:
- Display "message"                              (stdout with newline)
- Display "message" continuing                   (stdout without newline)
- Display "text" joined with value               (stdout with value concatenation)
- Display "a" joined with b joined with c        (multiple joined values)

AUTOMATIC TYPE CONVERSION:
- Integers → string representation
- Floats → string representation
- Booleans → "true" or "false"
- Strings → pass through

This is the primary stdout output mechanism for the Runa language, designed
to surpass Python's print() with natural language clarity.

Process called "integer_to_string" that takes value as Integer, buffer as Integer, buffer_size as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Convert integer to string representation
    Note: Returns length of string written, or 0 on error

    Note: Handle negative values
    If value is less than 0:

        Let source_pos be digit_count minus i minus 1
        Let char be proc memory_get_byte from MemoryCore with temp_buffer plus source_pos, 0

Process called "boolean_to_string" that takes value as Integer, buffer as Integer, buffer_size as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Convert boolean to "true" or "false"
    Note: Returns length of string written

        Note: Write "true"

Process called "float_to_string" that takes value as Integer, buffer as Integer, buffer_size as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Convert float to string representation with 6 decimal places
    Note: Returns length of string written, or 0 on error

    If buffer_size is less than 32:
        Return 0  Note: Need space for sign, digits, decimal, precision, null
    End If

    Note: For now, convert the integer part and add ".000000"
    Note: Full IEEE 754 float parsing requires complex bit manipulation
    Note: This is a simplified implementation for integers stored as floats

    Let integer_part be value  Note: Treating as integer for simplified version

    If int_len is equal to 0:
