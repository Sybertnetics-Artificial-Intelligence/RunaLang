Note:
This file handles NetBSD ARM64 register management and register operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process NetBSD ARM64 register allocation and register management
- Handle NetBSD ARM64 register constraints and register usage optimization
- Manage NetBSD ARM64 register spilling and register optimization
- Process NetBSD ARM64 register-based operations and register optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- NetBSD ARM64 register management is crucial for efficient NetBSD ARM64 code generation
- Proper register handling ensures optimal NetBSD ARM64 CPU resource utilization
- NetBSD ARM64 support enables Runa compilation for NetBSD ARM64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- NetBSD ARM64 register allocation and register management
- NetBSD ARM64 register constraints and register usage optimization
- NetBSD ARM64 register spilling and register optimization
- NetBSD ARM64 register-based operations and register optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement NetBSD ARM64 registers functionality
