MIPS64 Machine Code Generation

This file implements MIPS64 machine code generation for the Runa compiler.

Platform-specific details:
- Platform: Linux MIPS64 (little-endian)
- Instruction format: 32-bit fixed-length (even for 64-bit operations!)
- Byte order: Little-endian
- Encoding: Binary machine code

MIPS64 machine code encoding:
- All instructions are exactly 4 bytes (32 bits)
- Little-endian byte order (LSB first)
- 64-bit operations use 32-bit instruction encoding
- No variable-length or prefix encoding
- Immediate values are sign-extended where applicable

Instruction emission:
- R-type: Register-register operations
- I-type: Immediate and load/store operations
- J-type: Jump operations
- Proper alignment required (4-byte boundaries)

Dependencies: compiler/frontend/primitives/core/memory_core.runa
