Note:
This file handles NetBSD x64 instruction set and instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process NetBSD x64 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- Handle NetBSD x64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Manage NetBSD x64 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- Process NetBSD x64 instruction validation and instruction verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- NetBSD x64 instruction processing enables native NetBSD x64 code generation
- Proper instruction handling ensures correct and efficient NetBSD x64 code
- NetBSD x64 support enables Runa compilation for NetBSD x64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- NetBSD x64 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- NetBSD x64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- NetBSD x64 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- NetBSD x64 instruction validation and instruction verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement NetBSD x64 instructions functionality
