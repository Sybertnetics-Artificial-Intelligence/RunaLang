PLATFORM SKELETON: This file needs platform-specific implementation

This file implements low-level system calls for [PLATFORM_NAME] [ARCHITECTURE].

Platform-specific details:
- OS: [PLATFORM_NAME]
- Architecture: [ARCHITECTURE]
- Syscall convention: [DESCRIBE_CONVENTION]
- Register usage: [DESCRIBE_REGISTERS]

This implementation provides:
1. Generic syscall wrappers (syscall_0 through syscall_6) for 0-6 arguments
2. High-level wrappers for common syscalls (read, write, open, close, etc.)
3. Syscall number constants for this platform
4. Platform-specific syscall ABI details

TODO: Implement platform-specific syscall functionality
TODO: Add syscall number constants for this platform
TODO: Implement inline assembly for syscall invocation
TODO: Add high-level wrapper functions
