Note:
This file handles NetBSD x64 calling convention and function call interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process NetBSD x64 calling convention rules and parameter passing
- Handle NetBSD x64-specific register usage and register allocation
- Manage NetBSD x64 stack frame management and stack operations
- Process NetBSD x64 function call optimization and call interface

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- NetBSD x64 calling convention ensures correct function calls on NetBSD x64 systems
- Proper calling convention handling enables system integration and library compatibility
- NetBSD x64 support enables Runa compilation for NetBSD x64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- NetBSD x64 calling convention processing and parameter passing
- NetBSD x64 register usage and register allocation
- NetBSD x64 stack frame management and stack operations
- NetBSD x64 function call optimization and call interface
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement NetBSD x64 calling convention functionality
