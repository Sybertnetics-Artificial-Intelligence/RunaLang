Note:
This file handles FreeBSD x64 calling convention and function call interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process FreeBSD x64 calling convention rules and parameter passing
- Handle FreeBSD x64-specific register usage and register allocation
- Manage FreeBSD x64 stack frame management and stack operations
- Process FreeBSD x64 function call optimization and call interface

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- FreeBSD x64 calling convention ensures correct function calls on FreeBSD x64 systems
- Proper calling convention handling enables system integration and library compatibility
- FreeBSD x64 support enables Runa compilation for FreeBSD x64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- FreeBSD x64 calling convention processing and parameter passing
- FreeBSD x64 register usage and register allocation
- FreeBSD x64 stack frame management and stack operations
- FreeBSD x64 function call optimization and call interface
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement FreeBSD x64 calling convention functionality
