Note:
This file implements FPGA calling convention primitives for field-programmable gate array execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process FPGA kernel calling convention definitions and field-programmable gate array parameter passing mechanisms
- Handle FPGA pipeline configuration and hardware synthesis with FPGA memory space specifications
- Manage FPGA kernel launch parameters and execution configuration with hardware synthesis optimization
- Process FPGA memory hierarchy and addressing modes with block RAM and distributed RAM coordination
- Handle FPGA pipeline execution and synchronization primitives with hardware synthesis optimization
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Handle FPGA debugging support and performance monitoring primitives
- Process FPGA target architecture support and hardware synthesis optimization level management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- calling_convention enables comprehensive FPGA kernel calling convention support and field-programmable gate array execution primitives
- Proper FPGA calling convention ensures correct kernel parameter passing and hardware synthesis execution configuration
- calling_convention support enables Runa compiler for advanced FPGA field-programmable gate array programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- FPGA kernel calling convention definitions and field-programmable gate array parameter passing mechanisms
- FPGA pipeline configuration and hardware synthesis with FPGA memory space specifications
- FPGA kernel launch parameters and execution configuration with hardware synthesis optimization
- FPGA memory hierarchy and addressing modes with block RAM and distributed RAM coordination
- FPGA pipeline execution and synchronization primitives with hardware synthesis optimization
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- FPGA debugging support and performance monitoring primitives
- FPGA target architecture support and hardware synthesis optimization level management
