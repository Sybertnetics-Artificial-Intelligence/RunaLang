Note:
This file implements FPGA register primitives for field-programmable gate array execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process FPGA register file definitions and field-programmable gate array register architecture support
- Handle FPGA general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers with FPGA register allocation
- Manage FPGA vector registers and SIMD register operations with hardware synthesis-level register management
- Process FPGA register pressure analysis and spill code generation with FPGA memory hierarchy
- Handle FPGA register coalescing and move elimination with FPGA optimization
- Process FPGA register debugging support and performance monitoring with FPGA register usage analysis
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Process FPGA target architecture support and FPGA register optimization level management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- registers enables comprehensive FPGA register architecture support and field-programmable gate array register management primitives
- Proper FPGA registers ensure correct FPGA register allocation and optimization
- registers support enables Runa compiler for advanced FPGA field-programmable gate array programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- FPGA register file definitions and field-programmable gate array register architecture support
