Note:
This file handles platform selection and platform-specific code generation.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process platform detection and platform selection
- Handle platform-specific code generation and platform optimization
- Manage platform abstraction and platform-independent code generation
- Process platform configuration and platform-specific feature selection

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Platform selection enables cross-platform Runa compilation
- Proper platform handling ensures correct code generation for target platforms
- Platform abstraction supports portable Runa applications

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Platform detection and platform selection
- Platform-specific code generation and platform optimization
- Platform abstraction and platform-independent code generation
- Platform configuration and platform-specific feature selection
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement platform selector functionality
