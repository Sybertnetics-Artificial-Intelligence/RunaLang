Note:
This file handles OpenBSD x64 register management and register operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process OpenBSD x64 register allocation and register management
- Handle OpenBSD x64 register constraints and register usage optimization
- Manage OpenBSD x64 register spilling and register optimization
- Process OpenBSD x64 register-based operations and register optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- OpenBSD x64 register management is crucial for efficient OpenBSD x64 code generation
- Proper register handling ensures optimal OpenBSD x64 CPU resource utilization
- OpenBSD x64 support enables Runa compilation for OpenBSD x64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- OpenBSD x64 register allocation and register management
- OpenBSD x64 register constraints and register usage optimization
- OpenBSD x64 register spilling and register optimization
- OpenBSD x64 register-based operations and register optimization
