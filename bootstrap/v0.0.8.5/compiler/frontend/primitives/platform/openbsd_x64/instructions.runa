Note:
This file handles OpenBSD x64 instruction set and instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process OpenBSD x64 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- Handle OpenBSD x64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Manage OpenBSD x64 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- Process OpenBSD x64 instruction validation and instruction verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- OpenBSD x64 instruction processing enables native OpenBSD x64 code generation
- Proper instruction handling ensures correct and efficient OpenBSD x64 code
- OpenBSD x64 support enables Runa compilation for OpenBSD x64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- OpenBSD x64 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- OpenBSD x64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- OpenBSD x64 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- OpenBSD x64 instruction validation and instruction verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement OpenBSD x64 instructions functionality
