OpenBSD x86-64 System Call Interface

This file implements OpenBSD x86-64 (AMD64) system calls.

Platform-specific details:
- Platform: OpenBSD x86-64
- Syscall mechanism: syscall instruction
- Syscall number register: RAX
- Argument registers: RDI, RSI, RDX, R10, R8, R9 (up to 6 arguments)
- Return value: RAX (positive on success, negative errno on error)

OpenBSD syscall convention (x86-64):
- RAX = syscall number
- RDI, RSI, RDX, R10, R8, R9 = arguments 1-6
- Stack = arguments 7+ (if needed)
- RAX = return value (or -errno on error)
- RCX and R11 are clobbered by syscall

OpenBSD syscall numbers differ from Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Darwin.
This file provides both syscall number constants and wrapper functions.

Dependencies: None (uses inline assembly for syscalls)
