Note:
This file handles PowerPC calling convention and function call interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process PowerPC calling convention rules and parameter passing
- Handle PowerPC-specific register usage and register allocation
- Manage PowerPC stack frame management and stack operations
- Process PowerPC function call optimization and call interface

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- PowerPC calling convention ensures correct function calls on PowerPC systems
- Proper calling convention handling enables system integration and library compatibility
- PowerPC support enables Runa compilation for PowerPC platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- PowerPC calling convention processing and parameter passing
- PowerPC register usage and register allocation
- PowerPC stack frame management and stack operations
- PowerPC function call optimization and call interface
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement PowerPC calling convention functionality
