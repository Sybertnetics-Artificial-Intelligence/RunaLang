PowerPC 64-bit Machine Code Generation

This file implements PowerPC 64-bit machine code encoding for the Runa compiler.

Platform-specific details:
- OS: Linux
- Architecture: PowerPC 64-bit (ppc64le)
- Instruction format: Fixed-length (32-bit/4 bytes)
- Encoding: Little-endian
- Instruction structure: Fixed 32-bit format with encoded fields

PowerPC 64-bit instruction encoding:
- Fixed length: 4 bytes per instruction (RISC architecture)
- Byte order: Little-endian (ppc64le)
- Format: [op|rd|ra|rb|...] (fields vary by instruction type)
- Register encoding: 5 bits (0-31)
- Immediate encoding: Varies by instruction (typically 16-26 bits)
- Branch offsets: PC-relative with specific ranges

This implementation provides core instruction encoders for:
- Data movement (LI, LIS, MR, LD, STD, LWZ, STW)
- Arithmetic (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV)
- Logic (AND, OR, XOR, NAND)
- Control flow (B, BL, BLR, BCTR)
- Load/Store (LD, STD, LWZ, STW, LHA, STH)
- System calls (SC)

Dependencies: registers.runa for register number mappings

Process called "get_instruction_length" takes instruction_ptr as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Get encoded length in bytes for PowerPC instruction
    Note: All PowerPC instructions are 4 bytes
    Note: Returns: 4 (fixed length), or 0 on error
    
    If instruction_ptr is equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If
    
    Return 4
End Process

Process called "encode_instruction" takes instruction_ptr as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Generic instruction encoder - delegates to specific encoders
    Note: instruction_ptr: pointer to instruction structure
    Note: Returns: pointer to encoded bytes, or 0 on error
    
    If instruction_ptr is equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If
    
    Note: This is a generic interface - specific encoders should be called directly
    Note: based on instruction type from the instruction structure
    Return 0
End Process

Process called "get_encoded_instruction" takes buffer_ptr as Integer, instruction_index as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Get encoded instruction at specific index
    Note: buffer_ptr: pointer to instruction buffer
    Note: instruction_index: index of instruction (0-based)
    Note: Returns: pointer to instruction bytes, or 0 on error
    
    If buffer_ptr is equal to 0 or instruction_index is less than 0:
        Return 0
    End If
    
    Let instruction_addr be buffer_ptr plus 4 plus (instruction_index multiplied by 4)
    Return instruction_addr
End Process

Process called "get_buffer_size" takes buffer_ptr as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Get total size of encoded instructions in buffer
    Note: buffer_ptr: pointer to instruction buffer
    Note: Returns: size in bytes, or 0 on error
    
    If buffer_ptr is equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If
    
    Let current_pos be get_buffer_position(buffer_ptr)
    Return current_pos
End Process

Process called "align_buffer" takes buffer_ptr as Integer, alignment as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Align instruction buffer to specified boundary
    Note: buffer_ptr: pointer to instruction buffer
    Note: alignment: alignment boundary (must be power of 2)
    Note: Returns: 1 on success, 0 on failure
    
    If buffer_ptr is equal to 0 or alignment is less than or equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If
    
    Let current_pos be get_buffer_position(buffer_ptr)
