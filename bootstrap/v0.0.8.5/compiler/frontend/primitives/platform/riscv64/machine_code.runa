RISC-V 64-bit Machine Code Generation

This file implements RISC-V 64-bit machine code encoding for the Runa compiler.

Platform-specific details:
- OS: Linux
- Architecture: RISC-V 64-bit (RV64I)
- Instruction format: Fixed-length (32-bit/4 bytes)
- Encoding: Little-endian
- Instruction structure: Fixed 32-bit format with encoded fields

RISC-V 64-bit instruction encoding:
- Fixed length: 4 bytes per instruction (RISC architecture)
- Byte order: Little-endian
- Format: [opcode|rd|funct3|rs1|rs2|funct7] (fields vary by instruction type)
- Register encoding: 5 bits (0-31)
- Immediate encoding: Varies by instruction (typically 12-20 bits)
- Branch offsets: PC-relative with specific ranges
- 64-bit operations with 32-bit compatibility (W-type instructions)

This implementation provides core instruction encoders for:
- Data movement (LUI, AUIPC, ADDI, ADDIW, MV)
- Arithmetic (ADD, SUB, ADDW, SUBW, MUL, DIV)
- Logic (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
- Control flow (JAL, JALR, BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE)
- Load/Store (LD, SD, LW, SW, LWU, LB, SB, LH, SH)
- System calls (ECALL, EBREAK)

Dependencies: registers.runa for register number mappings
