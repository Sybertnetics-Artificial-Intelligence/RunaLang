Note:
This file implements OpenCL instruction primitives for cross-platform GPU execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process OpenCL C instruction definitions and cross-platform GPU instruction set architecture support
- Handle OpenCL memory instructions and addressing modes with global, local, and private memory
- Manage OpenCL arithmetic and logical instructions with vector operations and SIMD support
- Process OpenCL control flow instructions and branch prediction with work group execution
- Handle OpenCL synchronization instructions and barrier operations with work group coordination
- Process OpenCL mathematical instructions and transcendental functions with cross-platform optimization
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Process OpenCL debugging support and performance monitoring instructions

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- instructions enables comprehensive OpenCL instruction set support and cross-platform GPU execution primitives
- Proper OpenCL instructions ensure correct OpenCL C code generation and cross-platform GPU execution
- instructions support enables Runa compiler for advanced OpenCL GPU programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- OpenCL C instruction definitions and cross-platform GPU instruction set architecture support
