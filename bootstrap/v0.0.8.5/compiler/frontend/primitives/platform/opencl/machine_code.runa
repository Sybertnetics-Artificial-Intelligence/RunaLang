PLATFORM SKELETON: Machine Code Generation for [PLATFORM_NAME] [ARCHITECTURE]

This file implements machine code generation for [PLATFORM_NAME] [ARCHITECTURE].

Platform-specific details:
- OS: [PLATFORM_NAME]
- Architecture: [ARCHITECTURE]
- Instruction format: [DESCRIBE_FORMAT]
- Encoding: [DESCRIBE_ENCODING]

Machine code encoding is platform-specific:
- Instruction length: [fixed/variable]
- Byte order: [little-endian/big-endian]
- Special prefixes/suffixes: [DESCRIBE]

TODO: Implement platform-specific machine code generation
TODO: Add instruction encoding functions
TODO: Implement optimization passes
TODO: Add platform-specific encoding details
