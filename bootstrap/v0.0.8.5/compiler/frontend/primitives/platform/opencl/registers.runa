Note:
This file implements OpenCL register primitives for cross-platform GPU execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process OpenCL register file definitions and cross-platform GPU register architecture support
- Handle OpenCL general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers with cross-platform register allocation
- Manage OpenCL vector registers and SIMD register operations with work group-level register management
- Process OpenCL register pressure analysis and spill code generation with cross-platform GPU memory hierarchy
- Handle OpenCL register coalescing and move elimination with cross-platform GPU optimization
- Process OpenCL register debugging support and performance monitoring with cross-platform register usage analysis
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Process OpenCL target architecture support and cross-platform register optimization level management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- registers enables comprehensive OpenCL register architecture support and cross-platform GPU register management primitives
- Proper OpenCL registers ensure correct cross-platform GPU register allocation and optimization
- registers support enables Runa compiler for advanced OpenCL GPU programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- OpenCL register file definitions and cross-platform GPU register architecture support
- OpenCL general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers with cross-platform register allocation
