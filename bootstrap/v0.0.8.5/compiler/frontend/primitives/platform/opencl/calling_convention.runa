Note:
This file implements OpenCL calling convention primitives for cross-platform GPU execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process OpenCL kernel calling convention definitions and cross-platform parameter passing mechanisms
- Handle OpenCL work group and work item configuration with device-specific memory space specifications
- Manage OpenCL kernel launch parameters and execution configuration with device abstraction
- Process OpenCL memory hierarchy and addressing modes with global, local, and private memory coordination
- Handle OpenCL work group execution and synchronization primitives with device-specific optimization
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Handle OpenCL debugging support and performance monitoring primitives
- Process OpenCL target architecture support and optimization level management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- calling_convention enables comprehensive OpenCL kernel calling convention support and cross-platform GPU execution primitives
- Proper OpenCL calling convention ensures correct kernel parameter passing and cross-platform execution configuration
- calling_convention support enables Runa compiler for advanced OpenCL GPU programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- OpenCL kernel calling convention definitions and cross-platform parameter passing mechanisms
- OpenCL work group and work item configuration with device-specific memory space specifications
- OpenCL kernel launch parameters and execution configuration with device abstraction
- OpenCL memory hierarchy and addressing modes with global, local, and private memory coordination
- OpenCL work group execution and synchronization primitives with device-specific optimization
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- OpenCL debugging support and performance monitoring primitives
- OpenCL target architecture support and optimization level management
