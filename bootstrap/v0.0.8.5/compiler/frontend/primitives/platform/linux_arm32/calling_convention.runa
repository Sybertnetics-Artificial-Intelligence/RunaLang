Note:
This file handles Linux ARM32 calling convention and function call interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Linux ARM32 calling convention rules and parameter passing
- Handle Linux ARM32-specific register usage and register allocation
- Manage Linux ARM32 stack frame management and stack operations
- Process Linux ARM32 function call optimization and call interface

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Linux ARM32 calling convention ensures correct function calls on Linux ARM32 systems
- Proper calling convention handling enables system integration and library compatibility
- Linux ARM32 support enables Runa compilation for Linux ARM32 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Linux ARM32 calling convention processing and parameter passing
- Linux ARM32 register usage and register allocation
- Linux ARM32 stack frame management and stack operations
- Linux ARM32 function call optimization and call interface
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement Linux ARM32 calling convention functionality
