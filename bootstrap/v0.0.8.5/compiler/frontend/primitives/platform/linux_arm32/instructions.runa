Note:
This file handles Linux ARM32 instruction set and instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Linux ARM32 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- Handle Linux ARM32 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Manage Linux ARM32 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- Process Linux ARM32 instruction validation and instruction verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Linux ARM32 instruction processing enables native Linux ARM32 code generation
- Proper instruction handling ensures correct and efficient Linux ARM32 code
- Linux ARM32 support enables Runa compilation for Linux ARM32 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Linux ARM32 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- Linux ARM32 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Linux ARM32 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- Linux ARM32 instruction validation and instruction verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement Linux ARM32 instructions functionality
