Note:
This file handles Darwin x86-64 calling convention and function call interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Darwin x86-64 calling convention rules and parameter passing
- Handle Darwin x86-64-specific register usage and register allocation
- Manage Darwin x86-64 stack frame management and stack operations
- Process Darwin x86-64 function call optimization and call interface

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Darwin x86-64 calling convention ensures correct function calls on Intel Mac systems
- Proper calling convention handling enables system integration and library compatibility
- Darwin x86-64 support enables Runa compilation for Intel Mac platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Darwin x86-64 calling convention processing and parameter passing
- Darwin x86-64 register usage and register allocation
- Darwin x86-64 stack frame management and stack operations
- Darwin x86-64 function call optimization and call interface
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement Darwin x86-64 calling convention functionality
