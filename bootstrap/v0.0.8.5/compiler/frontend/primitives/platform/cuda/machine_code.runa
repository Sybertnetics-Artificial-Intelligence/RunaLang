CUDA PTX Code Generation

This file implements PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) code generation.

Platform-specific details:
- Platform: CUDA (NVIDIA GPU)
- Architecture: PTX (Parallel Thread Execution)
- Output Format: PTX assembly text
- Compilation: PTX â†’ SASS by CUDA driver at runtime

PTX is a virtual ISA that acts as a portable intermediate representation:
1. Text-based assembly format
2. Explicitly typed instructions (add.s32, mul.f64, etc.)
3. Unlimited virtual registers (%r0, %r1, ..., %f0, %f1, ..., %p0, %p1, ...)
4. Memory space annotations (.global, .shared, .local, .const, .param)
5. Version-independent (forward compatible)

PTX to SASS compilation:
- PTX is compiled to native SASS (Streaming ASSembler) by the CUDA driver
- SASS is architecture-specific binary code
- PTX provides portability, SASS provides performance

This implementation generates PTX assembly text.
