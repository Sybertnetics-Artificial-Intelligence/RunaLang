CUDA PTX Register Architecture

This file implements CUDA/PTX register primitives for GPU kernel execution.

Platform-specific details:
- Platform: CUDA (NVIDIA GPU)
- Architecture: PTX (Parallel Thread Execution)
- Register Model: Virtual register file (unlimited virtual registers)
- Register Types: .b (bit), .u (unsigned), .s (signed), .f (float)

PTX uses a virtual register architecture:
1. Unlimited virtual registers (compiler allocates as needed)
2. Register types: .b8/.b16/.b32/.b64, .u8/.u16/.u32/.u64, .s8/.s16/.s32/.s64, .f32/.f64
3. Predicate registers: .pred (for conditional execution)
4. Special registers: %tid, %ntid, %ctaid, %nctaid, %warpid, %laneid, %clock, %clock64

Physical register mapping:
- 32-bit registers: R0-R254 (hardware dependent)
- 64-bit registers: RD0-RD126 (pairs of 32-bit registers)
- Predicate registers: P0-P6 (boolean flags)

This implementation provides register management for PTX code generation.
