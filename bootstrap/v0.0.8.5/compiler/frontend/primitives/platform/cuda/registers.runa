Note:
This file implements CUDA register primitives for GPU kernel execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process CUDA register file definitions and GPU register architecture support
- Handle CUDA general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers with register allocation
- Manage CUDA vector registers and SIMD register operations with warp-level register management
- Process CUDA register pressure analysis and spill code generation with GPU memory hierarchy
- Handle CUDA register coalescing and move elimination with GPU optimization
- Process CUDA register debugging support and performance monitoring with register usage analysis
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Process CUDA target architecture support and register optimization level management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- registers enables comprehensive CUDA register architecture support and GPU register management primitives
- Proper CUDA registers ensure correct GPU register allocation and optimization
- registers support enables Runa compiler for advanced CUDA GPU programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- CUDA register file definitions and GPU register architecture support
- CUDA general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers with register allocation
