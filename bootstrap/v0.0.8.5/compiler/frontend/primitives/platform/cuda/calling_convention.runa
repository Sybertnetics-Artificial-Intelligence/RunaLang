Note:
This file implements CUDA calling convention primitives for GPU kernel execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process CUDA kernel calling convention definitions and parameter passing mechanisms
- Handle CUDA thread block and grid configuration with memory space specifications
- Manage CUDA kernel launch parameters and execution configuration
- Process CUDA memory hierarchy and addressing modes with shared memory coordination
- Handle CUDA warp-level execution and synchronization primitives
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Handle CUDA debugging support and performance monitoring primitives
- Process CUDA target architecture support and optimization level management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- calling_convention enables comprehensive CUDA kernel calling convention support and GPU execution primitives
- Proper CUDA calling convention ensures correct kernel parameter passing and execution configuration
- calling_convention support enables Runa compiler for advanced CUDA GPU programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- CUDA kernel calling convention definitions and parameter passing mechanisms
- CUDA thread block and grid configuration with memory space specifications
- CUDA kernel launch parameters and execution configuration
- CUDA memory hierarchy and addressing modes with shared memory coordination
- CUDA warp-level execution and synchronization primitives
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- CUDA debugging support and performance monitoring primitives
- CUDA target architecture support and optimization level management
