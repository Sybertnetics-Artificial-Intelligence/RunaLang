CUDA Kernel Calling Convention

This file implements CUDA kernel calling convention and execution model.

Platform-specific details:
- Platform: CUDA (NVIDIA GPU)
- Architecture: PTX (Parallel Thread Execution)
- Execution Model: SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Thread)
- Memory Model: Global, Shared, Local, Constant, Texture

CUDA execution model:
1. Kernels launch with grid of thread blocks
2. Each block contains multiple threads (up to 1024)
3. Threads execute in warps of 32
4. Memory hierarchy: Registers > Shared > L1 > L2 > Global
5. Synchronization at block level (not grid level)

Parameter passing:
1. Kernel parameters passed via .param space
2. Maximum 4KB of kernel parameters
3. Parameters aligned to their natural size
4. Device function parameters passed via registers or stack

Memory spaces:
- .reg: Register space (per-thread, fastest)
- .shared: Shared memory (per-block, 48KB-96KB)
- .local: Local memory (per-thread, spillover to global)
- .global: Global memory (device-wide, slowest)
- .const: Constant memory (read-only, cached)
- .param: Parameter space (kernel arguments)
