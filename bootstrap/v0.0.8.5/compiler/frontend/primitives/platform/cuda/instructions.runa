Note:
This file implements CUDA instruction primitives for GPU kernel execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process CUDA PTX instruction definitions and GPU instruction set architecture support
- Handle CUDA memory instructions and addressing modes with global, shared, and local memory
- Manage CUDA arithmetic and logical instructions with vector operations and SIMD support
- Process CUDA control flow instructions and branch prediction with warp-level execution
- Handle CUDA synchronization instructions and barrier operations with thread coordination
- Process CUDA mathematical instructions and transcendental functions with GPU optimization
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Process CUDA debugging support and performance monitoring instructions

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- instructions enables comprehensive CUDA instruction set support and GPU kernel execution primitives
- Proper CUDA instructions ensure correct PTX assembly generation and GPU execution
