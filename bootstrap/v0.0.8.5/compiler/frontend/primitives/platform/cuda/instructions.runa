CUDA PTX Instruction Set

This file implements PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) instruction primitives.

Platform-specific details:
- Platform: CUDA (NVIDIA GPU)
- Architecture: PTX (Parallel Thread Execution)
- ISA: Virtual instruction set compiled to SASS by driver
- Version: PTX 7.x+ (Compute Capability 7.0+)

PTX Instruction Categories:
1. Data Movement: mov, ld, st, cvt
2. Arithmetic: add, sub, mul, div, mad, fma
3. Logical: and, or, xor, not, shl, shr
4. Comparison: setp, set
5. Control Flow: bra, call, ret, exit
6. Synchronization: bar, membar, atom
7. Special: tex, suld, sust (texture/surface)
8. Warp-level: shfl, vote, match

PTX is a virtual ISA - these instructions are compiled to native SASS
(Streaming ASSembler) by the CUDA driver at runtime.
