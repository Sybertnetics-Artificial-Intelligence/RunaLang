Metal Shading Language (MSL) Code Generation

This file implements MSL source code generation for the Metal backend.

Unlike traditional machine code generation, Metal uses:
1. MSL source code generation (C++14-based)
2. Runtime compilation via Metal compiler
3. Binary caching (metallib format)

Compilation Pipeline:
1. Generate MSL source code
2. Compile to Metal IR (AIR - Apple Intermediate Representation)
3. Link to metallib binary
4. Load at runtime

Platform: Metal (Apple Silicon and Intel GPUs)
