Note:
This file implements Metal calling convention primitives for Apple GPU execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Metal kernel calling convention definitions and Apple GPU parameter passing mechanisms
- Handle Metal thread group and thread configuration with Apple GPU memory space specifications
- Manage Metal kernel launch parameters and execution configuration with Apple GPU optimization
- Process Metal memory hierarchy and addressing modes with thread group memory coordination
- Handle Metal thread group execution and synchronization primitives with Apple GPU optimization
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Handle Metal debugging support and performance monitoring primitives
- Process Metal target architecture support and Apple GPU optimization level management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- calling_convention enables comprehensive Metal kernel calling convention support and Apple GPU execution primitives
- Proper Metal calling convention ensures correct kernel parameter passing and Apple GPU execution configuration
- calling_convention support enables Runa compiler for advanced Metal Apple GPU programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Metal kernel calling convention definitions and Apple GPU parameter passing mechanisms
- Metal thread group and thread configuration with Apple GPU memory space specifications
- Metal kernel launch parameters and execution configuration with Apple GPU optimization
- Metal memory hierarchy and addressing modes with thread group memory coordination
- Metal thread group execution and synchronization primitives with Apple GPU optimization
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Metal debugging support and performance monitoring primitives
- Metal target architecture support and Apple GPU optimization level management
