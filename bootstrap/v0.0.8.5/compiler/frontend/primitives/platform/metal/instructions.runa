This file implements Metal instruction primitives for Apple GPU execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Metal Shading Language instruction definitions and Apple GPU instruction set architecture support
- Handle Metal memory instructions and addressing modes with thread group memory and device memory
- Manage Metal arithmetic and logical instructions with vector operations and Apple GPU SIMD support
- Process Metal control flow instructions and branch prediction with thread group execution
- Handle Metal synchronization instructions and barrier operations with thread group coordination
- Process Metal mathematical instructions and transcendental functions with Apple GPU optimization
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Process Metal debugging support and performance monitoring instructions

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- instructions enables comprehensive Metal instruction set support and Apple GPU execution primitives
- Proper Metal instructions ensure correct Metal Shading Language generation and Apple GPU execution
