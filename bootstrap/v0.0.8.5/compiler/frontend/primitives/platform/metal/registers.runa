Note:
This file implements Metal register primitives for Apple GPU execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process Metal register file definitions and Apple GPU register architecture support
- Handle Metal general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers with Apple GPU register allocation
- Manage Metal vector registers and SIMD register operations with thread group-level register management
- Process Metal register pressure analysis and spill code generation with Apple GPU memory hierarchy
- Handle Metal register coalescing and move elimination with Apple GPU optimization
- Process Metal register debugging support and performance monitoring with Apple GPU register usage analysis
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Process Metal target architecture support and Apple GPU register optimization level management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- registers enables comprehensive Metal register architecture support and Apple GPU register management primitives
- Proper Metal registers ensure correct Apple GPU register allocation and optimization
- registers support enables Runa compiler for advanced Metal Apple GPU programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Metal register file definitions and Apple GPU register architecture support
- Metal general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers with Apple GPU register allocation
