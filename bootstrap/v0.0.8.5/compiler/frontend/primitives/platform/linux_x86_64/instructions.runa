Note:
This file handles x86-64 instruction set and instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process x86-64 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- Handle x86-64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Manage x86-64 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- Process x86-64 instruction validation and instruction verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- x86-64 instruction processing enables native x86-64 code generation
- Proper instruction handling ensures correct and efficient x86-64 code
- x86-64 support enables Runa compilation for x86-64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- x86-64 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- x86-64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- x86-64 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- x86-64 instruction validation and instruction verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement x86-64 instructions functionality
