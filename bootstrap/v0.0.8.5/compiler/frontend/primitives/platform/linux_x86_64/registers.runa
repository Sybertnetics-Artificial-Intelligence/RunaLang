Note:
This file handles x86-64 register management and register operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process x86-64 register allocation and register management
- Handle x86-64 register constraints and register usage optimization
- Manage x86-64 register spilling and register optimization
- Process x86-64 register-based operations and register optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- x86-64 register management is crucial for efficient x86-64 code generation
- Proper register handling ensures optimal x86-64 CPU resource utilization
- x86-64 support enables Runa compilation for x86-64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- x86-64 register allocation and register management
- x86-64 register constraints and register usage optimization
- x86-64 register spilling and register optimization
- x86-64 register-based operations and register optimization
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement x86-64 registers functionality
