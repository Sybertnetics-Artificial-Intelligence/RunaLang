Note:
This file handles OpenBSD ARM64 calling convention and function call interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process OpenBSD ARM64 calling convention rules and parameter passing
- Handle OpenBSD ARM64-specific register usage and register allocation
- Manage OpenBSD ARM64 stack frame management and stack operations
- Process OpenBSD ARM64 function call optimization and call interface

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- OpenBSD ARM64 calling convention ensures correct function calls on OpenBSD ARM64 systems
- Proper calling convention handling enables system integration and library compatibility
- OpenBSD ARM64 support enables Runa compilation for OpenBSD ARM64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- OpenBSD ARM64 calling convention processing and parameter passing
- OpenBSD ARM64 register usage and register allocation
- OpenBSD ARM64 stack frame management and stack operations
- OpenBSD ARM64 function call optimization and call interface
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement OpenBSD ARM64 calling convention functionality
