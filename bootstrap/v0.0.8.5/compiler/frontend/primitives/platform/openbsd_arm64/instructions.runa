Note:
This file handles OpenBSD ARM64 instruction set and instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process OpenBSD ARM64 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- Handle OpenBSD ARM64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Manage OpenBSD ARM64 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- Process OpenBSD ARM64 instruction validation and instruction verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- OpenBSD ARM64 instruction processing enables native OpenBSD ARM64 code generation
- Proper instruction handling ensures correct and efficient OpenBSD ARM64 code
- OpenBSD ARM64 support enables Runa compilation for OpenBSD ARM64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- OpenBSD ARM64 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- OpenBSD ARM64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- OpenBSD ARM64 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- OpenBSD ARM64 instruction validation and instruction verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement OpenBSD ARM64 instructions functionality
