Note:
This file handles FreeBSD ARM64 instruction set and instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process FreeBSD ARM64 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- Handle FreeBSD ARM64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Manage FreeBSD ARM64 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- Process FreeBSD ARM64 instruction validation and instruction verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- FreeBSD ARM64 instruction processing enables native FreeBSD ARM64 code generation
- Proper instruction handling ensures correct and efficient FreeBSD ARM64 code
- FreeBSD ARM64 support enables Runa compilation for FreeBSD ARM64 platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- FreeBSD ARM64 instruction encoding and instruction generation
- FreeBSD ARM64 instruction optimization and instruction selection
- FreeBSD ARM64 instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- FreeBSD ARM64 instruction validation and instruction verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement FreeBSD ARM64 instructions functionality
