Note:
This file handles MIPS calling convention and function call interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process MIPS calling convention rules and parameter passing
- Handle MIPS-specific register usage and register allocation
- Manage MIPS stack frame management and stack operations
- Process MIPS function call optimization and call interface

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- MIPS calling convention ensures correct function calls on MIPS systems
- Proper calling convention handling enables system integration and library compatibility
- MIPS support enables Runa compilation for MIPS platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- MIPS calling convention processing and parameter passing
- MIPS register usage and register allocation
- MIPS stack frame management and stack operations
- MIPS function call optimization and call interface
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement MIPS calling convention functionality
