Note:
This file handles MIPS register management and register operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process MIPS register allocation and register management
- Handle MIPS register constraints and register usage optimization
- Manage MIPS register spilling and register optimization
- Process MIPS register-based operations and register optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- MIPS register management is crucial for efficient MIPS code generation
- Proper register handling ensures optimal MIPS CPU resource utilization
- MIPS support enables Runa compilation for MIPS platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- MIPS register allocation and register management
- MIPS register constraints and register usage optimization
- MIPS register spilling and register optimization
- MIPS register-based operations and register optimization
