Note:
This file handles MIPS instruction set and instruction processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process MIPS instruction encoding and instruction generation
- Handle MIPS instruction optimization and instruction selection
- Manage MIPS instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- Process MIPS instruction validation and instruction verification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- MIPS instruction processing enables native MIPS code generation
- Proper instruction handling ensures correct and efficient MIPS code
- MIPS support enables Runa compilation for MIPS platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- MIPS instruction encoding and instruction generation
- MIPS instruction optimization and instruction selection
- MIPS instruction scheduling and instruction reordering
- MIPS instruction validation and instruction verification
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement MIPS instructions functionality
