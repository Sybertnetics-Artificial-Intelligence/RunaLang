Note:
This file implements DSP instruction primitives for digital signal processing execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process DSP instruction definitions and digital signal processing instruction set architecture support
- Handle DSP memory instructions and addressing modes with signal buffer memory and coefficient memory
- Manage DSP arithmetic and logical instructions with multiply-accumulate operations and vector operations
- Process DSP control flow instructions and branch prediction with pipeline execution
- Handle DSP synchronization instructions and barrier operations with pipeline coordination
- Process DSP mathematical instructions and transcendental functions with real-time processing optimization
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Process DSP debugging support and performance monitoring instructions

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- instructions enables comprehensive DSP instruction set support and digital signal processing execution primitives
- Proper DSP instructions ensure correct DSP assembly generation and real-time processing execution
- instructions support enables Runa compiler for advanced DSP digital signal processing programming workflows
