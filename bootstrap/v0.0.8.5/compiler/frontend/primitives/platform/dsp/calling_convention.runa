Note:
This file implements DSP calling convention primitives for digital signal processing execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process DSP kernel calling convention definitions and digital signal processing parameter passing mechanisms
- Handle DSP pipeline configuration and real-time processing with signal processing memory space specifications
- Manage DSP kernel launch parameters and execution configuration with real-time processing optimization
- Process DSP memory hierarchy and addressing modes with signal buffer memory coordination
- Handle DSP pipeline execution and synchronization primitives with real-time processing optimization
- Process integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Handle DSP debugging support and performance monitoring primitives
- Process DSP target architecture support and real-time processing optimization level management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- calling_convention enables comprehensive DSP kernel calling convention support and digital signal processing execution primitives
- Proper DSP calling convention ensures correct kernel parameter passing and real-time processing execution configuration
- calling_convention support enables Runa compiler for advanced DSP digital signal processing programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- DSP kernel calling convention definitions and digital signal processing parameter passing mechanisms
- DSP pipeline configuration and real-time processing with signal processing memory space specifications
- DSP kernel launch parameters and execution configuration with real-time processing optimization
- DSP memory hierarchy and addressing modes with signal buffer memory coordination
- DSP pipeline execution and synchronization primitives with real-time processing optimization
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- DSP debugging support and performance monitoring primitives
- DSP target architecture support and real-time processing optimization level management
