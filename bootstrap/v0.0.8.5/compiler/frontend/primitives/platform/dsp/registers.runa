Note:
This file implements DSP register primitives for digital signal processing execution in the Runa compiler frontend.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process DSP register file definitions and digital signal processing register architecture support
- Handle DSP general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers with DSP register allocation
- Manage DSP vector registers and SIMD register operations with pipeline-level register management
- Process DSP register pressure analysis and spill code generation with DSP memory hierarchy
- Handle DSP register coalescing and move elimination with DSP optimization
- Process DSP register debugging support and performance monitoring with DSP register usage analysis
- Handle integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- Process DSP target architecture support and DSP register optimization level management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- registers enables comprehensive DSP register architecture support and digital signal processing register management primitives
- Proper DSP registers ensure correct DSP register allocation and optimization
- registers support enables Runa compiler for advanced DSP digital signal processing programming workflows

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- DSP register file definitions and digital signal processing register architecture support
- DSP general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers with DSP register allocation
- DSP vector registers and SIMD register operations with pipeline-level register management
- DSP register pressure analysis and spill code generation with DSP memory hierarchy
- DSP register coalescing and move elimination with DSP optimization
- DSP register debugging support and performance monitoring with DSP register usage analysis
- Integration with Runa's dual syntax system and mathematical symbol optimization
- DSP target architecture support and DSP register optimization level management
