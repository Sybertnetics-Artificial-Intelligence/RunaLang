Note:
This file handles RISC-V calling convention and function call interface.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process RISC-V calling convention rules and parameter passing
- Handle RISC-V-specific register usage and register allocation
- Manage RISC-V stack frame management and stack operations
- Process RISC-V function call optimization and call interface

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- RISC-V calling convention ensures correct function calls on RISC-V systems
- Proper calling convention handling enables system integration and library compatibility
- RISC-V support enables Runa compilation for RISC-V platforms

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- RISC-V calling convention processing and parameter passing
- RISC-V register usage and register allocation
- RISC-V stack frame management and stack operations
- RISC-V function call optimization and call interface
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement RISC-V calling convention functionality
