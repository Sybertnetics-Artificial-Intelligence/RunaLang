Note:
This file handles function call processing and call instruction management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process function call instructions and call site management
- Handle call parameter passing and call return value processing
- Manage call stack operations and call frame management
- Process call optimization and call inlining

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Function calls are fundamental to modular programming and code organization
- Proper call handling ensures correct function invocation and parameter passing
- Call optimization improves runtime performance and reduces function call overhead

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Function call instruction processing and call site management
- Call parameter passing and return value handling
- Call stack operations and call frame management
- Call optimization and call inlining algorithms
