Note:
This file handles lambda expression processing and lambda closure management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process lambda expression creation and lambda closure generation
- Handle lambda function generation and lambda environment management
- Manage lambda invocation and lambda closure execution
- Process lambda parameter handling and lambda free variable capture

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Lambda expressions are fundamental to functional programming and closure support
- Proper lambda handling ensures correct closure generation and environment capture
- Lambda optimization improves performance for functional programming constructs

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Lambda expression processing and lambda closure generation
- Lambda function generation and lambda environment management
- Lambda invocation and lambda closure execution
- Lambda parameter handling and lambda free variable capture
