Note:
This file handles return instruction processing and function return management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process return instructions and function return value handling
- Handle return stack cleanup and return frame management
- Manage return value processing and return optimization
- Process return elimination and return optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Return instructions are fundamental to function execution and control flow
- Proper return handling ensures correct function termination and value return
- Return optimization improves runtime performance and reduces function overhead

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Return instruction processing and function return handling
- Return stack cleanup and return frame management
- Return value processing and return optimization
- Return elimination and return optimization algorithms
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement return functionality
