Note:
This file handles branch instruction processing and conditional control flow.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process branch instructions and conditional jumps
- Handle branch condition evaluation and branch optimization
- Manage branch target resolution and branch prediction
- Process branch elimination and branch optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Branch instructions are fundamental to conditional control flow
- Proper branch handling enables efficient conditional execution
- Branch optimization improves runtime performance and code efficiency

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Branch instruction processing and conditional jump handling
- Branch condition evaluation and branch optimization
- Branch target resolution and branch prediction
- Branch elimination and branch optimization algorithms
