Note:
This file handles branch instruction validation and optimization for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Validate branch conditions and branch types
- Detect unreachable branches and constant branch conditions
- Analyze branch prediction and branch target resolution
- Optimize branch elimination and branch chaining

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Branch validation ensures correct conditional control flow
- Constant folding eliminates dead branches at compile time
- Branch prediction hints improve runtime performance
- Branch chaining reduces unnecessary jumps

Dependencies:
- NONE (pure analysis and validation)
