Note:
This file handles jump instruction validation and optimization for the compiler.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Validate jump instructions and jump targets
- Analyze jump distance and encoding requirements
- Detect jump chains and optimization opportunities
- Validate goto statements and label targets

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Jump instructions must have valid targets
- Jump distance determines instruction encoding
- Jump chain elimination reduces unnecessary jumps
- Label validation ensures correct control flow

Dependencies:
- NONE (pure analysis and validation)
