Note:
This file handles jump instruction processing and unconditional control flow.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process jump instructions and unconditional control flow
- Handle jump target resolution and jump optimization
- Manage jump elimination and jump optimization
- Process jump prediction and jump optimization

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Jump instructions are fundamental to control flow and program structure
- Proper jump handling enables efficient control flow and loop optimization
- Jump optimization improves runtime performance and reduces control flow overhead

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Jump instruction processing and unconditional control flow handling
- Jump target resolution and jump optimization
- Jump elimination and jump optimization algorithms
- Jump prediction and jump optimization techniques
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement jump functionality
