Note:
This file handles control flow statement processing and control flow management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Process if statements and conditional execution
- Handle while loops and loop control
- Manage for loops and iteration control
- Process for_each loops and collection iteration
- Handle break and continue statements
- Manage return statements and function exit

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Control flow statements are fundamental to program execution and logic
- Proper control flow handling ensures correct program behavior and execution paths
- Control flow optimization improves performance for conditional and iterative operations

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- If statement processing and conditional execution
- While loop processing and loop control
- For loop processing and iteration control
- For_each loop processing and collection iteration
- Break and continue statement processing
- Return statement processing and function exit
