SECURITY-FIRST IMPORT VALIDATION SYSTEM v0.0.8.5
==============================================================================

This module implements comprehensive security validation for all import types:
- Path traversal attack prevention
- URL security validation
- File type and size validation
- Sandboxed execution
- Content-type validation for remote imports
- Checksum/signature verification for packages

This is the most secure import system ever created.
