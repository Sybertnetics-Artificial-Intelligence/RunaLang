REMOTE IMPORT RESOLUTION SYSTEM v0.0.8.5
==============================================================================

This module implements production-grade remote import resolution:
- URL imports with HTTPS download and caching (HTTPS blocked on TLS)
- Git repository cloning via system git command
- Registry imports (npm, crates.io, PyPI)
- Network security validation
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Cache management for remote resources

HTTP (non-secure) can be implemented now. HTTPS requires TLS from cryptography.
