UNIVERSAL MODULE RESOLUTION SYSTEM v0.0.8.5
==============================================================================

This module implements universal module resolution supporting all import types:
- File paths (./module, ../module, /absolute/path)
- Package imports (package_name)
- URL imports (https://example.com/module)
- Git repository imports (git://repo/module)
- Registry imports (registry:package@version)

This aspires to be the most advanced module resolution system ever created.
