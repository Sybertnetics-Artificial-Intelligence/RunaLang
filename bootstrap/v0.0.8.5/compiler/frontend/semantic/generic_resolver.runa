Note:
This file handles generic type resolution and type parameter processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Resolve generic type parameters and type arguments
- Handle generic type instantiation and specialization
- Process generic constraints and type bounds
- Manage generic type inference and type unification

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Generic types enable code reuse and type-safe abstractions
- Proper generic resolution ensures type safety and correctness
- Generic type inference improves developer experience and code clarity

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Generic type parameter resolution and instantiation
- Type argument processing and specialization
- Generic constraint validation and type bounds checking
- Type inference and type unification algorithms
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement generic resolver functionality
