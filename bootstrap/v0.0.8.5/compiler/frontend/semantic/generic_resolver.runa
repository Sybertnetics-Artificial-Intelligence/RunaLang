Note:
This file handles generic type resolution and type parameter processing.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Resolve generic type parameters and type arguments with memory-efficient operations
- Handle generic type instantiation and specialization with arena-based temporary analysis
- Process generic constraints and type bounds with ownership-aware operations
- Manage generic type inference and type unification with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Generic types enable code reuse and type-safe abstractions
- Proper generic resolution ensures type safety and correctness
- Generic type inference improves developer experience and code clarity
- Memory-efficient generic resolution enables scalable type system

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Generic type parameter resolution and instantiation with ownership patterns
- Type argument processing and specialization with arena-based operations
- Generic constraint validation and type bounds checking with memory safety
- Type inference and type unification algorithms with deterministic cleanup
