Note:
This file implements semantic analysis for pattern matching in Runa.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Analyze pattern bindings and detect duplicate variable bindings
- Type check patterns against scrutinee types
- Check exhaustiveness of match statements
- Analyze pattern irrefutability for Let statements
- Validate variant constructors and type compatibility
- Track pattern variable scope and lifetime

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Pattern matching safety requires comprehensive semantic validation
- Binding analysis prevents variable shadowing and duplicate bindings
- Exhaustiveness checking ensures all cases are handled
- Irrefutability analysis prevents runtime match failures in Let statements
- Type checking ensures pattern-value compatibility

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Pattern binding analysis and duplicate detection
- Pattern type checking and compatibility validation
- Match exhaustiveness checking with coverage analysis
- Pattern irrefutability determination
- Variant constructor validation
- Pattern variable scope tracking

Dependencies:
- Imports type_checker.runa for type compatibility checking
- Imports symbol_table.runa for variable binding tracking
- Imports scope_analyzer.runa for scope management
- Imports ast.runa for pattern AST node types
- Imports memory/layout.runa for structure allocation
