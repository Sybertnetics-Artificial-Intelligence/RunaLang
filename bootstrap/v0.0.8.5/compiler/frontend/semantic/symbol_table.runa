Note:
This file implements the symbol table for symbol management and name resolution.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Manage symbol definitions and symbol lookups with proper ownership patterns
- Handle symbol scope and symbol visibility with memory-efficient operations
- Process symbol resolution and name binding with arena-based temporary lookups
- Manage symbol table operations and symbol lifecycle with deterministic cleanup

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Symbol tables enable accurate name resolution and symbol lookup
- Proper symbol management prevents naming conflicts and resolution errors
- Symbol tables support all language features requiring name resolution
- Memory-efficient symbol management enables scalable semantic analysis

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Symbol definition and symbol lookup management with ownership tracking
- Symbol scope and visibility handling with arena-based temporary operations
- Name resolution and symbol binding with memory-safe operations
- Symbol table operations and symbol lifecycle management with deterministic cleanup
