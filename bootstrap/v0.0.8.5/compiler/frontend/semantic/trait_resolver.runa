Note:
This file handles trait resolution and trait-based type system operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Resolve trait implementations and trait bounds
- Handle trait method resolution and trait method dispatch
- Process trait constraints and trait-based type checking
- Manage trait inheritance and trait composition

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Traits enable powerful type system abstractions and polymorphism
- Proper trait resolution ensures type safety and method dispatch correctness
- Trait-based programming supports flexible and reusable code design

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Trait implementation resolution and trait bound checking
- Trait method resolution and method dispatch
- Trait constraint validation and trait-based type checking
- Trait inheritance and trait composition management
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement trait resolver functionality
