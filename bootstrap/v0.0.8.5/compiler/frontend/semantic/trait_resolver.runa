Note:
This file handles trait resolution and trait-based type system operations.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Resolve trait implementations and trait bounds with memory-efficient operations
- Handle trait method resolution and trait method dispatch with arena-based temporary analysis
- Process trait constraints and trait-based type checking with ownership-aware operations
- Manage trait inheritance and trait composition with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Traits enable powerful type system abstractions and polymorphism
- Proper trait resolution ensures type safety and method dispatch correctness
- Trait-based programming supports flexible and reusable code design
- Memory-efficient trait resolution enables scalable type system

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Trait implementation resolution and trait bound checking with ownership patterns
- Trait method resolution and method dispatch with arena-based operations
- Trait constraint validation and trait-based type checking with memory safety
- Trait inheritance and trait composition management with deterministic cleanup
