Note:
This file implements the borrow checker for ownership and memory safety analysis.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Analyze ownership patterns and borrow relationships in Runa code with memory-efficient operations
- Enforce ownership rules and prevent memory safety violations with arena-based temporary analysis
- Handle move semantics and ownership transfer validation with ownership-aware operations
- Process ownership tracking and lifetime analysis with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Ownership tracking is a key v0.0.8.5 feature for memory safety
- Borrow checking prevents data races and memory safety issues
- Proper ownership analysis enables safe concurrent programming
- Memory-efficient ownership analysis enables scalable compilation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Ownership pattern analysis and validation with ownership tracking
- Borrow relationship tracking and enforcement with arena-based operations
- Move semantics processing and validation with memory safety
- Lifetime analysis and ownership transfer handling with deterministic cleanup
