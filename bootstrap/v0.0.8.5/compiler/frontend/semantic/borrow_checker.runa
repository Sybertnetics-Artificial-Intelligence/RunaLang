Note:
This file implements the borrow checker for ownership and memory safety analysis.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Analyze ownership patterns and borrow relationships in Runa code
- Enforce ownership rules and prevent memory safety violations
- Handle move semantics and ownership transfer validation
- Process ownership tracking and lifetime analysis - v0.0.8.5 feature

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Ownership tracking is a key v0.0.8.5 feature for memory safety
- Borrow checking prevents data races and memory safety issues
- Proper ownership analysis enables safe concurrent programming

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Ownership pattern analysis and validation
- Borrow relationship tracking and enforcement
- Move semantics processing and validation
- Lifetime analysis and ownership transfer handling
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement borrow checker functionality for ownership tracking v0.0.8.5
