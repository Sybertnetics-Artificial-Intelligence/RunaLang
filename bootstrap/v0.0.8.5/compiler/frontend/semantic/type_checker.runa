Note:
This file implements type checking and type validation for Runa programs.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Perform type checking and type validation across all language constructs
- Handle type inference and type deduction
- Process type compatibility and type conversion validation
- Manage type error detection and type error reporting

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Type checking ensures program correctness and prevents type-related errors
- Proper type validation enables safe and reliable program execution
- Type inference improves developer experience and code clarity

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Type checking and type validation algorithms
- Type inference and type deduction processing
- Type compatibility checking and type conversion validation
- Type error detection and type error reporting
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement type checker functionality
