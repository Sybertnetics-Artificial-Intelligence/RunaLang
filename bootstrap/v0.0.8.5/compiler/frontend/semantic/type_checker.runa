Note:
This file implements type checking and type validation for Runa programs.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Perform type checking and type validation across all language constructs with memory-efficient operations
- Handle type inference and type deduction with arena-based temporary analysis
- Process type compatibility and type conversion validation with ownership-aware operations
- Manage type error detection and type error reporting with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Type checking ensures program correctness and prevents type-related errors
- Proper type validation enables safe and reliable program execution
- Type inference improves developer experience and code clarity
- Memory-efficient type checking enables scalable semantic analysis

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Type checking and type validation algorithms with ownership patterns
- Type inference and type deduction processing with arena-based operations
- Type compatibility checking and type conversion validation with memory safety
- Type error detection and type error reporting with deterministic cleanup
