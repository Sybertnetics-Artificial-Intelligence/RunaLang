Note:
This file implements scope analysis for variable and symbol scope management.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Analyze variable and symbol scope boundaries and visibility with memory-efficient operations
- Handle scope nesting and scope resolution with arena-based temporary analysis
- Process scope-based symbol lookup and name resolution with ownership-aware operations
- Manage scope lifetime and scope cleanup with deterministic memory management

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Scope analysis ensures proper variable and symbol visibility
- Proper scope management prevents naming conflicts and scope errors
- Scope resolution enables accurate symbol lookup and name binding
- Memory-efficient scope analysis enables scalable semantic analysis

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Scope boundary analysis and scope nesting management with ownership tracking
- Symbol scope resolution and name lookup with arena-based temporary operations
- Scope lifetime tracking and scope cleanup with deterministic memory management
- Scope-based symbol visibility and access control with ownership validation
