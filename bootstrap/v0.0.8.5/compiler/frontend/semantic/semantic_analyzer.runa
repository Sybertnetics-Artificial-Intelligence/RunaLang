Note:
This file implements the main semantic analyzer for Runa source code analysis.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Coordinate semantic analysis across all semantic components
- Manage semantic analysis state and context
- Handle semantic error detection and reporting
- Provide the primary interface for semantic analysis

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Semantic analysis ensures program correctness and type safety
- Centralized semantic analysis coordinates all semantic components
- Proper semantic analysis enables accurate code generation and optimization

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Main semantic analyzer orchestration and coordination
- Semantic analysis state management and context handling
- Integration with specialized semantic components
- Semantic error detection and reporting
:End Note

Note: TODO - Implement main semantic analyzer functionality
