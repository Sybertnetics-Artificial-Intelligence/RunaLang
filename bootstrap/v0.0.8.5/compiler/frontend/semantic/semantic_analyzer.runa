Note:
This file implements the main semantic analyzer for Runa source code analysis.

This file performs the following tasks:
- Coordinate semantic analysis across all semantic components with proper memory management
- Manage semantic analysis state and context with ownership-aware operations
- Handle semantic error detection and reporting with arena-based temporary operations
- Provide the primary interface for semantic analysis with deterministic memory patterns

This file is essential because of the following reasons:
- Semantic analysis ensures program correctness and type safety
- Centralized semantic analysis coordinates all semantic components
- Proper semantic analysis enables accurate code generation and optimization
- Memory-efficient semantic analysis enables scalable compilation

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Main semantic analyzer orchestration and coordination with ownership tracking
- Semantic analysis state management and context handling with arena-based operations
- Integration with specialized semantic components with proper memory patterns
- Semantic error detection and reporting with deterministic cleanup
