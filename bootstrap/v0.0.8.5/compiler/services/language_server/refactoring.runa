- Proper refactoring handling ensures correct refactoring operation execution
- Refactoring support enables Runa compilation for LSP-integrated refactoring handling

This file consists of the following functions/features/operation types:
- Code refactoring and LSP refactoring integration
- Refactoring operations and refactoring transformation
- Refactoring validation and refactoring verification
- Refactoring communication and refactoring protocol implementation
