Note: Comprehensive test for range expression feature
Note: Tests both "to" (exclusive) and "through" (inclusive) range operators

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test 1: Basic exclusive range (1 to 5)
    Display "Test 1: Range 1 to 5 (exclusive):\n"

    Note: Test 2: Basic inclusive range (1 through 5)
    Display "Test 2: Range 1 through 5 (inclusive):\n"
    Let range2 be 1 through 5
    Set i to 0

        Display "  "
        Display value
        Display "\n"
        Set i to i plus 1

    Let start_val be 1 plus 1

    Note: Test 4: Range starting from 10
    Display "Test 4: Range 10 through 12:\n"
    Let range4 be 10 through 12
    Set i to 0
    While i is less than 3:

        Display "  "
        Display value
        Display "\n"
        Set i to i plus 1

    Note: Test 5: Single element range
    Display "Test 5: Range 7 through 7 (single element):\n"

    Let value be range5 at index 0
    Display "  "
    Display value

    Note: Test 6: Range with zero
    Display "Test 6: Range 0 to 3:\n"
    Let range6 be 0 to 3
    Set i to 0
    While i is less than 3:

        Display "  "
        Display value
        Display "\n"
        Set i to i plus 1
    End While

    Note: Test 7: Negative range
    Display "Test 7: Range -3 through -1:\n"
    Let range7 be 0 minus 3 through 0 minus 1
    Set i to 0
    While i is less than 3:
