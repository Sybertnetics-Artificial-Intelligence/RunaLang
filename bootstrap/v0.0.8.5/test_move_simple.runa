Note: Simple test for move semantics
Process called "takes_ownership" takes data as Integer returns Integer:
    Return data
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let data be 42

    Note: Move data to function
    Let result be takes_ownership(move data)

    Note: This should work - we use result, not data
    print_integer(result)

    Return 0
End Process
