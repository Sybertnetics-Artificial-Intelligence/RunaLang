Note: Test for-range loops with "to" and "through"

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test "to" (exclusive end)
    Let sum1 be 0
    For i from 1 to 5:
        Set sum1 to sum1 plus i
    End For
    Note: Should be 1+2+3+4 = 10

    If sum1 is not equal to 10:
        Return 1  Note: Failed: "to" loop should sum to 10
    End If

    Note: Test "through" (inclusive end)
    Let sum2 be 0
    For j from 1 through 5:
        Set sum2 to sum2 plus j
    End For
    Note: Should be 1+2+3+4+5 = 15

    If sum2 is not equal to 15:
        Return 2  Note: Failed: "through" loop should sum to 15
    End If

    Note: Test with step
    Let sum3 be 0
    For k from 0 to 10 by 2:
        Set sum3 to sum3 plus k
    End For
    Note: Should be 0+2+4+6+8 = 20

    If sum3 is not equal to 20:
        Return 3  Note: Failed: "to" with step should sum to 20
    End If

    Return 0  Note: All tests passed
End Process
