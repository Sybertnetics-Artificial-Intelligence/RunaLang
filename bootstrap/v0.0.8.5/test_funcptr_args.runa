Process called "add" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a plus b
End Process

Process called "multiply" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a multiplied by b
End Process

Process called "apply_operation" takes fn as Integer, x as Integer, y as Integer returns Integer:
    Return fn(x, y)
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let add_ptr be $add
    Let mult_ptr be $multiply
    
    Let sum be apply_operation(add_ptr, 3, 4)
    Let product be apply_operation(mult_ptr, 3, 4)
    
    If sum is equal to 7:
        If product is equal to 12:
            Display "SUCCESS"
            Return 0
        End If
    End If
    
    Display "FAIL"
    Return 1
End Process
