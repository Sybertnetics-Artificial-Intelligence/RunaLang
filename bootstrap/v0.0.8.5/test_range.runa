Note: Test range expressions - "to" (exclusive) vs "through" (inclusive)

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test "to" (exclusive) - should print 1,2,3,4
    display("Testing 'to' (exclusive 1 to 5):")
    For i from 1 to 5:
        display(integer_to_string(i))
    End For

    Note: Test "through" (inclusive) - should print 1,2,3,4,5
    display("Testing 'through' (inclusive 1 through 5):")
    For j from 1 through 5:
        display(integer_to_string(j))
    End For

    Note: Test with step
    display("Testing 'through' with step (0 through 10 by 2):")
    For k from 0 through 10 by 2:
        display(integer_to_string(k))
    End For

    Return 0
End Process
