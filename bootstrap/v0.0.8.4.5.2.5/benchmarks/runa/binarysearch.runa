Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let n be 10000
    Let searches be 1000
    Let arr be allocate(n multiplied by 8)

    Let i be 0
    While i is less than n:
        Let offset be i multiplied by 8
        memory_set_integer(arr, offset, i)
        Set i to i plus 1
    End While

    Let total be 0
    Set i to 0
    While i is less than searches:
        Let target be i modulo by n
        Let left be 0
        Let right be n minus 1

        While left is less than or equal to right:
            Let mid be left plus right
            Set mid to mid divided by 2
            Let mid_offset be mid multiplied by 8
            Let mid_val be memory_get_integer(arr, mid_offset)

            If mid_val is equal to target:
                Set total to total plus mid
                Set left to right plus 1
            Otherwise If mid_val is less than target:
                Set left to mid plus 1
            Otherwise:
                Set right to mid minus 1
            End If
        End While

        Set i to i plus 1
    End While

    deallocate(arr)
    Return 0
