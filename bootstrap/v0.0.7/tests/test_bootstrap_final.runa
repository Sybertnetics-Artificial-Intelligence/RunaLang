Process called "f1" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a plus b
    Return result
End Process

Process called "f2" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a minus b
    Return result
End Process

Process called "f3" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a multiplied by b
    Return result
End Process

Process called "f4" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a divided by b
    Return result
End Process

Process called "f5" takes w as Integer, x as Integer, y as Integer, z as Integer returns Integer:
    Let sum be f1(w, x)
    Let diff be f2(y, z)
    Let product be f3(sum, diff)
    Let final be f4(product, 2)
    Return final
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let r1 be f1(10, 20)
    Print r1

    Let r2 be f2(100, 25)
    Print r2

    Let r3 be f3(6, 8)
    Print r3

    Let r4 be f4(84, 7)
    Print r4

    Let r5 be f5(10, 15, 50, 30)
    Print r5

    Return 0
