Process called "add3" takes a as Integer, b as Integer, c as Integer returns Integer:
    Let sum be a plus b plus c
    Return sum
End Process

Process called "complex_calc" takes w as Integer, x as Integer, y as Integer, z as Integer, m as Integer, n as Integer returns Integer:
    Let step1 be add3(w, x, y)
    Let step2 be z multiplied by m
    Let step3 be step2 divided by n
    Let final be step1 plus step3
    Return final
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let simple be add3(10, 20, 30)
    Print simple

    Let complex be complex_calc(5, 10, 15, 24, 8, 4)
    Print complex

    Let v1 be 100
    Let v2 be 200
    Let v3 be 300
    Let v4 be 400
    Let v5 be 500
    Let v6 be 600
    Let v7 be 700
    Let v8 be 800
    Let v9 be 900
    Let v10 be 1000

    Let big_sum be v1 plus v2 plus v3 plus v4 plus v5 plus v6 plus v7 plus v8 plus v9 plus v10
    Print big_sum

    Return 0
