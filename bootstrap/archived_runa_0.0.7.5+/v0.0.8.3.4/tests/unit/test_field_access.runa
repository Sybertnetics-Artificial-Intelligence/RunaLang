Note: Test field access with natural language syntax and calculation
Type called "Rectangle":
    width as Integer
    height as Integer
End Type

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Create a Rectangle using struct construction
    Let rect be a Rectangle with width 10 and height 20

    Note: Read fields and calculate area
    Let w be the width of rect
    Let h be the height of rect
    Display w
    Display h

    Let area be w multiplied by h
    Display area

    Note: Modify dimensions
    Set the width of rect to 15
    Set the height of rect to 30

    Note: Recalculate with new dimensions
    Let new_w be the width of rect
    Let new_h be the height of rect
    Let new_area be new_w multiplied by new_h
    Display new_area

    deallocate(rect)

    Return 0
End Process
