Process called "add" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a plus b
End Process

Process called "multiply" takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a multiplied by b
End Process

Process called "factorial" takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    If n is less than or equal to 1:
        Return 1
    End If
    Let n_minus_1 be n minus 1
    Let recursive_result be factorial(n_minus_1)
    Return n multiplied by recursive_result
End Process
