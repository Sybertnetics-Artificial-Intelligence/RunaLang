# Test for CRITICAL FIX #3: Complete "is not" comparison support
# Tests all comparison operators with "is not" prefix

Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    Let x be 5
    Let y be 10

    End If

    # Test 2: is not less than (equivalent to >=)
    If y is not less than x:
        Display("PASS: Test 2 - is not less than")
    Otherwise:
        Display("FAIL: Test 2 - is not less than")
    End If

    # Test 3: is not greater than (equivalent to <=)
    If x is not greater than y:
