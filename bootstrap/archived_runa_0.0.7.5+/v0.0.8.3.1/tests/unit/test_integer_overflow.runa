Note: Test integer overflow behavior
Note: This tests what happens when adding to max int64
Note: Expected: Should wrap around (2's complement behavior)

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test overflow with max int64
    Note: Max int64 = 9223372036854775807
    Let max_int be 9223372036854775807
    Let one be 1
    Let overflow be max_int plus one

    Note: In 2's complement, max + 1 wraps to min int64
    Note: If we got here without crashing, test passes

    Note: Test negative overflow with large negative
    Let neg_large be -9223372036854775000
    Let underflow be neg_large minus 1000

    Note: If we got here without crashing, test passes
    Return 0
End Process
