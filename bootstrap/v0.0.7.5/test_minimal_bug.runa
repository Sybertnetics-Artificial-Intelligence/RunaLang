Process called "test_minimal_bug" takes stats as Integer returns Integer:
    Let x be 5
    If x is greater than 0:
        Set x to x multiplied by 2
    End If
    memory_set_integer(stats, 0, x)

    Let y be 10
    Set y to y divided by 2
    memory_set_integer(stats, 8, y)

    Return 1
End Process
