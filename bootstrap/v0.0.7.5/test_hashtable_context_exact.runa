Process called "test_hashtable_context_exact" takes stats as Integer returns Integer:
    Let bucket_count be 100
    Let entry_count be 50

    # Calculate load factor (multiplied by 100 for integer representation)
    Let load_factor be entry_count multiplied by 100
    Set load_factor to load_factor divided by bucket_count
    memory_set_integer(stats, 40, load_factor)

    Return 1
End Process
