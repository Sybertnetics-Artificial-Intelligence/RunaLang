# Fibonacci Sequence Example
# Demonstrates iterative calculation

Process called "fibonacci" takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    If n is less than or equal to 0:
        Return 0
    End If

    If n is equal to 1:
        Return 1
    End If

    Let prev be 0
    Let current be 1
    Let i be 2
    Let continue_loop be 1

    While continue_loop is equal to 1:
        Let next be prev plus current
        Set prev to current
        Set current to next
        Set i to i plus 1

        If i is greater than n:
            Set continue_loop to 0
        End If
    End While

    Return current
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    # Print first 10 Fibonacci numbers
    Let i be 0
    Let continue_printing be 1

    system_print("Fibonacci sequence (first 10 numbers):")

    While continue_printing is equal to 1:
        Let fib be fibonacci(i)
        Let fib_str be integer_to_string(fib)
        system_print(fib_str)

        Set i to i plus 1
        If i is greater than or equal to 10:
            Set continue_printing to 0
        End If
    End While

    Return 0
End Process
