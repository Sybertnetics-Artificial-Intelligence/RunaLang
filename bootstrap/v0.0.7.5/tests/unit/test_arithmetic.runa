# Arithmetic Operations Test
# Tests basic arithmetic operations

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    # Test addition
    Let sum be 10 plus 20
    If sum is not equal to 30:
        Return 1
    End If

    # Test subtraction
    Let diff be 50 minus 20
    If diff is not equal to 30:
        Return 2
    End If

    # Test multiplication using v0.0.7.3 syntax
    Let product be 6 multiplied by 7
    If product is not equal to 42:
        Return 3
    End If

    # Test division
    Let quotient be 100 divided by 5
    If quotient is not equal to 20:
        Return 4
    End If

    # Test modulo
    Let remainder be 17 modulo 5
    If remainder is not equal to 2:
        Return 5
    End If

    # Test compound expressions
    Let compound be 10 plus 5 multiplied by 2
    If compound is not equal to 20:
        Return 6
    End If

    # All tests passed
    Return 0
End Process
