Process called "main" takes argc as Integer, argv as Integer returns Integer:
    # Test LET statements
    Let x be 10
    Let y be 20

    # Test SET statement
    Set x to 15

    # Test IF statement
    If x is greater than y:
        Return 0
    Otherwise:
        # Test WHILE statement
        Let counter be 0
        Let result be 0
        While counter is less than 3:
            Set result to result plus x
            Set counter to counter plus 1
        End While

        # Test nested IF
        If result is equal to 45:
            Return 1  # Success!
        Otherwise:
            Return 99  # Unexpected result
        End If
    End If
