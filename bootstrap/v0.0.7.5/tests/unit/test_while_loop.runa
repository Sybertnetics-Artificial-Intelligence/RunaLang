# While Loop Test
# Tests various while loop patterns

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    # Test counting loop
    Let i be 0
    Let count be 0
    Let continue_counting be 1

    While continue_counting is equal to 1:
        Set count to count plus 1
        Set i to i plus 1
        If i is equal to 10:
            Set continue_counting to 0
        End If
    End While

    If count is not equal to 10:
        Return 1
    End If

    # Test factorial calculation
    Let n be 5
    Let factorial be 1
    Let continue_factorial be 1

    While continue_factorial is equal to 1:
        If n is greater than 1:
            Set factorial to factorial multiplied by n
            Set n to n minus 1
        Otherwise:
            Set continue_factorial to 0
        End If
    End While

    # 5! = 120
    If factorial is not equal to 120:
        Return 2
    End If

    # Test loop with multiple exit conditions
    Let x be 0
    Let y be 100
    Let continue_search be 1

    While continue_search is equal to 1:
        Set x to x plus 3
        Set y to y minus 5

        If x is greater than y:
            Set continue_search to 0
        End If

        If x is greater than 50:
            Set continue_search to 0
        End If
    End While

    # Loop should exit when x > y (around x=42, y=30)
    If x is less than 40:
        Return 3
    End If

    Return 0
