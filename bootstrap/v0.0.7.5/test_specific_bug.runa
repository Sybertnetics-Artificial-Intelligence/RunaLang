Process called "test_specific_bug" takes stats as Integer returns Integer:
    Let bucket_count be 100
    Let entry_count be 50
    Let total_chain_length be 10
    Let non_empty_buckets be 70

    Let average_chain_length be 0
    If non_empty_buckets is greater than 0:
        Set average_chain_length to total_chain_length multiplied by 100
        Set average_chain_length to average_chain_length divided by non_empty_buckets
    End If
    memory_set_integer(stats, 32, average_chain_length)

    Let load_factor be entry_count multiplied by 100
    Set load_factor to load_factor divided by bucket_count
    memory_set_integer(stats, 40, load_factor)

    Return 1
End Process
