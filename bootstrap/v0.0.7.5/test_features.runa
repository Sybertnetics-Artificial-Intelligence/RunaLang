Process called "factorial" takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    If n is less than or equal to 1:
        Return 1
    End If
    Let recursive_call be factorial(n minus 1)
    Return n multiplied by recursive_call
End Process

Process called "test_while_and_let" returns Integer:
    Let count be 0
    Let sum be 0
    While count is less than 5:
        Let sum be sum plus count
        Let count be count plus 1
    End While
    Return sum
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Let fact5 be factorial(5)
    If fact5 is equal to 120:
        Let sum_result be test_while_and_let()
        If sum_result is equal to 10:
            Return 0  # Success
        End If
    End If
    Return 1  # Failure
End Process
