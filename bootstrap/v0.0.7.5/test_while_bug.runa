Process called "test_while_bug" takes stats as Integer returns Integer:
    Let bucket_count be 100
    Let entry_count be 50
    Let i be 0
    Let non_empty_buckets be 70

    Let average_chain_length be 0
    While i is less than 1:
        Set average_chain_length to 10 multiplied by 100
        Set average_chain_length to average_chain_length divided by non_empty_buckets
        Set i to i plus 1
    End While
    memory_set_integer(stats, 32, average_chain_length)

    Let load_factor be entry_count multiplied by 100
    Set load_factor to load_factor divided by bucket_count
    memory_set_integer(stats, 40, load_factor)

    Return 1
End Process
