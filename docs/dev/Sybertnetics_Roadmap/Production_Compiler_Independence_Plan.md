# Production Compiler Independence Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic path to eliminate external toolchain dependencies in the Runa compiler, achieving complete independence for production deployment. The plan progresses from the current bootstrap phase to a fully self-contained production compiler.

## Strategic Importance

**Production compilers require complete toolchain independence for:**
- Zero external dependencies in deployment environments
- Guaranteed reproducible builds across all platforms
- Corporate environments with restricted tool access
- Embedded/specialized systems without standard toolchains
- Complete control over code generation and optimization

## Current State Analysis

**Bootstrap Phase (v0.0-v0.1):**
- Uses gcc/clang for final linking
- Generates AT&T assembly text
- Maintains `-nostdlib -static` for libc independence
- Has basic built-in assembler foundation

**Risk Assessment:**
- External linker dependency creates deployment fragility
- Assembly text generation adds unnecessary conversion overhead
- Toolchain availability varies across deployment environments

## Phase 1: Direct Machine Code Generation

### Objective
Eliminate assembly text generation by producing machine code bytes directly from the compiler IR.

### Timeline: 2-3 months focused development

### Technical Implementation

#### Core Components Required:

**1. X86-64 Instruction Encoding Engine (2-3 weeks)**
```
Component: instruction_encoder.runa
Purpose: Convert IR operations to machine code bytes
```
- Implement Intel SDM Volume 2 instruction encoding tables
- Support all arithmetic, logical, and memory operations
- Handle immediate values and displacement encoding
- Support both legacy and REX prefix generation

**2. Register Allocation & Encoding (1 week)**
```
Component: register_manager.runa
Purpose: Map virtual registers to physical x86-64 registers
```
- Implement ModR/M byte generation
- Support all general-purpose registers (RAX-R15)
- Handle SIB byte encoding for complex addressing
- Implement register pressure management

**3. Memory Addressing Mode Encoder (2 weeks)**
```
Component: addressing_encoder.runa
Purpose: Encode all x86-64 addressing modes
```
- Direct register addressing
- Register + displacement [REG + disp32/8]
- Base + index + scale [BASE + INDEX*SCALE]
- RIP-relative addressing for position-independent code
- Segment override handling (when needed)

**4. Jump/Call Resolution Engine (1 week)**
```
Component: relocation_manager.runa
Purpose: Resolve forward references and generate relocations
```
- Two-pass compilation: symbol collection → address resolution
- Generate relocation table for linker consumption
- Handle near/far jump optimization
- Support both absolute and relative addressing

#### Machine Code Generation Example:
```
IR: MOVE reg_1, reg_2
Assembly: "movq %rax, %rbx"
Machine Code: [0x48, 0x89, 0xc3]

Breakdown:
- 0x48: REX.W prefix (64-bit operation)
- 0x89: MOV r/m64, r64 opcode
- 0xc3: ModR/M byte (11|000|011 = direct reg, rax→rbx)
```

#### Implementation Architecture:
```
CodeGenerator → InstructionEncoder → MachineCodeBuffer → ObjectFile
                       ↓
           X86InstructionSet → ByteStream → RelocationTable
```

### Deliverables:
- Complete x86-64 instruction encoder
- Machine code generation integrated into existing codegen
- Elimination of assembly text generation
- Performance benchmarks vs. assembly generation

## Phase 2: Built-in ELF Linker

### Objective
Eliminate external linker dependency by implementing complete ELF object file linking.

### Timeline: 1-2 months additional development

### Technical Implementation

#### Core Components Required:

**1. ELF Object File Generator (1 week)**
```
Component: elf_object_writer.runa
Purpose: Generate ELF object files from machine code
```
- ELF header generation with correct architecture flags
- Section table creation (.text, .data, .bss, .rodata)
- Symbol table generation with proper binding/visibility
- String table management for section/symbol names

**2. Section Merging Engine (1 week)**
```
Component: section_merger.runa
Purpose: Combine sections from multiple object files
```
- Merge identical sections (.text + .text → .text)
- Preserve section alignment requirements
- Handle section ordering for optimal layout
- Generate final section headers

**3. Symbol Resolution System (2 weeks)**
```
Component: symbol_resolver.runa
Purpose: Resolve undefined symbols across object files
```
- Global symbol table construction
- Undefined symbol detection and resolution
- Symbol conflict detection (multiple definitions)
- Weak symbol handling
- Common symbol resolution

**4. Relocation Processing Engine (2 weeks)**
```
Component: relocation_processor.runa
Purpose: Apply relocations to generate final executable
```
- Support all x86-64 relocation types:
  - R_X86_64_64 (absolute 64-bit addresses)
  - R_X86_64_PC32 (PC-relative 32-bit)
  - R_X86_64_PLT32 (procedure linkage table)
  - R_X86_64_GOTPCREL (global offset table)
- Calculate final addresses after section layout
- Apply address patches to machine code
- Generate executable ELF header

#### ELF Generation Pipeline:
```
ObjectFiles → SectionMerger → SymbolResolver → RelocationProcessor → Executable
     ↓              ↓              ↓                ↓
  .o files    Merged Sections  Symbol Table   Final Addresses   ELF Binary

## Conclusion

This plan provides a clear path to production-grade compiler independence. The phased approach ensures continuous progress while maintaining working compiler functionality throughout development.

**Investment justification**: 3-5 months of development effort yields permanent elimination of external dependencies, significant performance improvements, and complete control over the compilation pipeline.

**Strategic outcome**: Runa becomes a truly self-contained compiler suitable for any production environment without external toolchain requirements.
