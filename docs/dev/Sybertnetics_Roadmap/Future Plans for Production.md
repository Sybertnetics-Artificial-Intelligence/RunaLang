# Future Plans for Production

This document outlines the roadmap for future development projects that will be completed to fully flesh out the Runa programming language and its ecosystem. These initiatives represent the next phase of Runa's evolution from a core language implementation to a comprehensive, production-ready platform.

## Overview

As Runa transitions from initial development to production deployment, several key infrastructure components and advanced features need to be implemented. This roadmap prioritizes projects based on user impact, technical complexity, and resource requirements. Each project includes implementation timelines, resource estimates, and success metrics.

## In-House API

### Currency Exchange Rate API System

**Project Goal**: Develop an internal, high-performance currency exchange rate API to replace external dependencies and provide enterprise-grade financial data services for Runa applications.

**Current State**: 
- Runa's conversion system uses external APIs (ExchangeRate-API.com) with 30-minute caching
- Smart fallback mechanisms and rate limiting implemented
- Production-ready for initial deployments

**Target State**:
- Self-hosted, high-availability currency API
- Real-time rate aggregation from multiple sources
- Advanced caching and data validation
- Enterprise SLA with 99.9% uptime guarantee

#### Phase 1: Data Aggregation Engine (Q3 2025 - Weeks 1-3)
**Technical Implementation:**
- **Multi-source data collection**: Integrate 5+ primary forex data sources
  - Central banks (ECB, Federal Reserve, Bank of England)
  - Financial data providers (Reuters, Bloomberg feeds)
  - Cryptocurrency exchanges for digital asset rates
- **Data validation pipeline**: Implement anomaly detection and cross-source verification
- **Rate normalization**: Standardize data formats and precision across sources

**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- High-frequency data ingestion system
- PostgreSQL database with time-series optimization
- Redis caching layer for sub-second response times
- Data quality monitoring and alerting

#### Phase 2: API Service Layer (Q3 2025 - Weeks 4-6)
**Core API Development:**
- RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI specification
- GraphQL interface for flexible data queries
- WebSocket connections for real-time streaming rates
- Rate limiting and authentication system

**API Endpoints:**
```
GET /rates/latest?base=USD&symbols=EUR,GBP,JPY
GET /rates/historical?date=2025-01-15&base=USD
GET /rates/timeseries?start_date=2025-01-01&end_date=2025-01-31
WebSocket /ws/rates/stream?symbols=EUR,GBP
```

**Performance Targets:**
- Response time: <50ms for cached rates
- Throughput: 10,000+ requests/minute
- Data freshness: <30 seconds for major currency pairs

#### Phase 3: High Availability & Monitoring (Q3 2025 - Weeks 7-9)
**Infrastructure Scaling:**
- Multi-region deployment with automatic failover
- Load balancing across data centers
- Automated backup and disaster recovery
- Performance monitoring and observability

**Monitoring Dashboard:**
- Real-time rate accuracy metrics
- API performance analytics
- Data source health monitoring
- Cost optimization tracking

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Q3 2025 - Weeks 10-12)
**Enhanced Functionality:**
- Historical rate analysis and forecasting
- Volatility indicators and trend analysis
- Custom rate alerts and notifications
- Bulk conversion APIs for enterprise clients

**Integration Features:**
- Seamless integration with Runa's standard library
- Backward compatibility with external API fallbacks
- Migration tools for existing Runa applications

**Resource Requirements:**
- **Development Team**: 2 backend engineers, 1 DevOps engineer, 1 data engineer
- **Infrastructure Budget**: $500-1,500/month operating costs
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks from Q3 2025 funding to production deployment
- **Total Investment**: $60,000-120,000 development + $6,000-18,000 annual operations

**Success Metrics:**
- 99.9% API uptime
- <50ms average response time
- 100% rate accuracy compared to market standards
- $50,000+ annual savings vs external API costs at scale

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Maintain external API fallbacks during transition
- Gradual migration strategy with A/B testing
- Comprehensive data backup and rollback procedures
- Legal compliance review for financial data handling
