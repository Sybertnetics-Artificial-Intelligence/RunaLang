## Best Practices

### Symbol Selection Guidelines
- Use standard mathematical conventions for symbol meanings
- Prefer commonly recognized symbols over obscure variants
- Consider cultural and regional differences in symbol usage
- Validate symbol compatibility across target platforms

### Unicode Handling
- Always normalize Unicode text for consistent processing
- Handle both composed and decomposed character forms
- Test symbol display across different operating systems
- Provide fallback options for missing fonts

### Performance Considerations
- Cache frequently accessed symbols
- Use batch operations for multiple symbol lookups
- Profile symbol rendering performance on target devices
- Consider lazy loading for large symbol sets
