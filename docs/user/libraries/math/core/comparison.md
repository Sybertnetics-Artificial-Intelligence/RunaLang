## Performance Considerations

- **Tolerance Settings**: Use appropriate tolerance for floating-point comparisons
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose optimal sorting algorithms for data size
- **Vectorization**: Use vectorized operations for large datasets
- **Parallel Processing**: Leverage parallel sorting for very large arrays

## Best Practices

1. **Always Use Tolerance**: For floating-point comparisons, always specify appropriate tolerance
2. **Stable Sorting**: Use stable sorting when order of equal elements matters
3. **Choose Right Algorithm**: Select appropriate algorithms based on data characteristics
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Test with empty arrays, single elements, and identical values
5. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark operations with representative data sizes
