- **Precision Management**: Use appropriate precision levels for stability requirements
- **Error Monitoring**: Continuously monitor numerical errors during computation
- **Preconditioning**: Apply preconditioning to improve system conditioning

4. **Mitigation Planning**: Have error mitigation strategies ready
5. **Documentation**: Document stability assumptions and limitations
6. **Testing**: Test algorithms on ill-conditioned problems
