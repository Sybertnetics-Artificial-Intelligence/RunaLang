## Performance Considerations

- **Algorithm Selection**: Use `optimize_complexity_computation()` for best analysis performance
- **Caching**: Cache complex recurrence solutions and asymptotic analyses
- **Precision**: Higher precision complexity analysis increases computation time
- **Empirical Validation**: Combine theoretical analysis with empirical measurements

## Best Practices

1. **Validate Inputs**: Always validate function expressions and parameters
2. **Use Appropriate Models**: Choose the right computational model for analysis
3. **Combine Methods**: Use both theoretical and empirical complexity analysis
4. **Consider Practical Factors**: Account for constant factors and lower-order terms
5. **Document Assumptions**: Clearly state computational model assumptions
6. **Verify Results**: Cross-validate complexity results with multiple methods
