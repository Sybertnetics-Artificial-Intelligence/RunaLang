## Performance Considerations

- **Precision vs. Cost**: Higher-degree approximations provide better accuracy but increased computational cost
- **Domain Adaptation**: Adjust approximation intervals for optimal convergence
- **Error Monitoring**: Continuously monitor approximation error during computation

## Best Practices

1. **Problem Analysis**: Analyze target function properties before selecting approximation method
2. **Error Tolerance**: Set realistic error tolerance based on application requirements
3. **Method Validation**: Validate approximation results against analytical solutions when available
4. **Convergence Testing**: Always verify convergence properties of iterative methods
5. **Resource Management**: Consider memory and computational constraints in method selection
6. **Quality Metrics**: Use multiple quality metrics for comprehensive approximation assessment
