Note: Category Theory Module

The Category Theory module (`math/category`) provides comprehensive categorical mathematics capabilities for Runa, encompassing morphism theory, functor constructions, natural transformations, monadic operations, and their applications to both pure mathematics and functional programming. This module enables abstract mathematical reasoning and provides the theoretical foundation for functional programming patterns.

## Module Overview

The Category Theory module consists of three specialized submodules, each focusing on a specific aspect of categorical mathematics:

| Submodule | Description | Key Features |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **[Morphisms](morphisms.md)** | Morphism theory and universal constructions | Isomorphisms, limits/colimits, pullbacks/pushouts, equalizers, diagram chasing |
| **[Functors](functors.md)** | Functor theory and natural transformations | Covariant/contravariant functors, natural transformations, applicative functors |
| **[Monads](monads.md)** | Monadic constructions and computational effects | Monad laws, transformers, Kleisli categories, computational monads |

## Quick Start

### Basic Morphism Operations
```runa

## Architecture and Design

### Category Theory Foundations
The module implements categorical mathematics with rigorous adherence to mathematical definitions:

```runa
Note: Core categorical structures
Type called "CategoryStructure":
    objects as List[String]                       Note: Collection of objects
    morphisms as Dictionary[String, Dictionary[String, String]] Note: Hom-sets
    composition as Dictionary[String, String]     Note: Composition operation
    identity_morphisms as Dictionary[String, String] Note: Identity morphisms
    axioms_verified as Boolean                    Note: Category axioms satisfied
```

### Categorical Laws and Verification
All constructions include automatic verification of required laws:

```runa
Note: Law verification system
Process called "verify_categorical_laws" that takes structure as Dictionary[String, String], law_type as String returns Dictionary[String, Boolean]:
    Let verification_results be Dictionary[String, Boolean]()
    
    Note: Verify based on structure type
    If law_type == "category":
        Set verification_results["associativity"] to verify_associativity(structure)
        Set verification_results["identity"] to verify_identity_laws(structure)
    Otherwise If law_type == "functor":
        Set verification_results["composition_preservation"] to verify_composition_preservation(structure)
        Set verification_results["identity_preservation"] to verify_identity_preservation(structure)
    Otherwise If law_type == "monad":

        Set verification_results["left_identity"] to verify_left_identity(structure)
        Set verification_results["right_identity"] to verify_right_identity(structure)
    
    Return verification_results
```

### Integration Patterns
The module supports both pure categorical mathematics and practical programming applications:

```runa
Note: Mathematical vs. computational interface
Process called "create_categorical_interface" that takes application_type as String returns Dictionary[String, String]:
    Let interface_spec be Dictionary[String, String]()
    
    If application_type == "pure_mathematics":
        Set interface_spec["focus"] to "universal_properties_and_diagram_chasing"
        Set interface_spec["verification"] to "strict_mathematical_verification"
        Set interface_spec["examples"] to "topological_categories_algebraic_categories"
    Otherwise If application_type == "functional_programming":
        Set interface_spec["focus"] to "computational_monads_and_applicatives"
        Set interface_spec["verification"] to "law_checking_for_correctness"
