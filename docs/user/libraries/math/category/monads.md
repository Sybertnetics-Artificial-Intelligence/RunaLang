## Performance Considerations

- **Monad Stack Depth**: Minimize transformer stack depth for better performance
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Use lazy evaluation for expensive monadic computations
- **Effect Optimization**: Choose appropriate effect systems based on requirements
- **Memory Management**: Be aware of space leaks in monadic code

## Best Practices

1. **Law Verification**: Always verify monad laws for custom monads
2. **Transformer Ordering**: Consider transformer ordering for optimal performance
3. **Effect Minimization**: Use minimal effect sets for cleaner code
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage strong typing to prevent invalid compositions
5. **Documentation**: Document monadic effects and their interactions clearly
6. **Testing**: Test monadic code with property-based testing for laws
