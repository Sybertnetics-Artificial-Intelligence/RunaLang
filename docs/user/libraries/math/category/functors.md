Note: Left Kan extension Lan_j F
Let kan_extension_data = Dictionary with:
    "functor_F": functor_F
    "inclusion_j": "j: A ↪ B"  Note: Inclusion functor
    "extension_type": "left"

Let kan_extension = Functors.compute_kan_extension(kan_extension_data)
Display "Kan extension exists: " joined with String(kan_extension.extension_exists)
Display "Extension type: " joined with kan_extension.extension_type
Display "Universal property: " joined with String(kan_extension.universal_property)

Note: Pointwise Kan extension
If kan_extension.extension_exists:

## Error Handling

### Functor Construction Errors
```runa
Try:
    Note: Invalid functor (doesn't preserve composition)
    Let invalid_morphism_mapping = Dictionary[String, String]()
    Set invalid_morphism_mapping["f∘g"] to "wrong_morphism"  Note: Should be F(f)∘F(g)
    
    Let invalid_functor = Functor with:
        morphism_mapping: invalid_morphism_mapping
    
    Let invalid_verification = Functors.verify_functor_laws(invalid_functor)
Catch Errors.FunctorLawError as error:
    Display "Functor law violation: " joined with error.message
    Display "Composition not preserved"

Try:
    Note: Natural transformation with non-commuting squares
    Let non_natural = NaturalTransformation with:
        naturality_condition: false
        component_morphisms: Dictionary[String, String]()
    
    Let naturality_check = Functors.verify_naturality_condition(non_natural)
Catch Errors.NaturalityError as error:
    Display "Naturality error: " joined with error.message
    Display "Some squares do not commute"
```

### Category Errors
```runa
Try:
    Note: Invalid category (composition not associative)
    Let invalid_category = Category with:
        associativity_laws: false
        composition: Dictionary with: "non_associative": "true"
    
    Let category_check = Functors.verify_category_axioms(invalid_category)
Catch Errors.CategoryAxiomError as error:
    Display "Category axiom error: " joined with error.message
    Display "Associativity or identity laws violated"

Try:
    Note: Functor between incompatible categories
    Let incompatible_functor = Functor with:
        source_category: source_category
        target_category: Category with: objects: ["incompatible"]
    
    Let compatibility_check = Functors.verify_functor_compatibility(incompatible_functor)
Catch Errors.CategoryCompatibilityError as error:
    Display "Compatibility error: " joined with error.message
    Display "Source and target categories incompatible"
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Functor Composition**: Cache composed functors for repeated operations
- **Naturality Verification**: Use lazy evaluation for expensive commutativity checks
- **Category Construction**: Build categories incrementally to avoid redundant verification
- **Representation**: Use efficient data structures for large categories

## Best Practices

1. **Functor Laws**: Always verify functor laws before use in constructions
2. **Naturality**: Check naturality conditions for all natural transformations
3. **Category Axioms**: Ensure categories satisfy axioms before functor construction
4. **Composition**: Verify functor composition associativity in complex constructions
5. **Type Safety**: Use strong typing to prevent invalid category mappings
6. **Documentation**: Document variance and preservation properties clearly
