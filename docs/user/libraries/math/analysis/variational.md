## Performance Considerations

- **Direct Methods**: Use sparse matrix techniques for large finite element systems
- **Optimal Control**: Employ multiple shooting for boundary value problems
- **Dynamic Programming**: Use adaptive grids to handle curse of dimensionality
- **Variational Inequalities**: Choose iterative solvers appropriate for problem structure

## Best Practices

1. **Problem Formulation**: Verify existence and uniqueness conditions before solving
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure boundary conditions are compatible with variational formulation
3. **Constraint Qualification**: Check constraint qualifications for constrained problems
4. **Numerical Methods**: Match discretization to problem smoothness and geometry
5. **Error Estimation**: Use a posteriori error estimates for adaptive methods
6. **Physical Consistency**: Verify solutions satisfy physical conservation laws when applicable
