## Error Handling

### Space and Operator Validation
```runa
Try:
    Note: Invalid norm definition
    Let invalid_space = BanachSpace with:
        norm: Dictionary with: "negative_value": "-1"
    
    Let validation_result = FunctionalAnalysis.verify_banach_space_axioms(invalid_space)
Catch Errors.NormViolationError as error:
    Display "Norm error: " joined with error.message
    Display "Norm must be non-negative"

Try:
    Note: Unbounded operator on inappropriate domain
    Let unbounded_op = LinearOperator with:
        is_bounded: false
        domain: l2_space  Note: Defined on all of L²
    
    Let norm_computation = FunctionalAnalysis.compute_operator_norm(unbounded_op)
Catch Errors.UnboundedOperatorError as error:
    Display "Operator error: " joined with error.message
    Display "Unbounded operators require appropriate domains"
```

### Convergence and Compactness Errors
```runa
Try:
    Note: Weak convergence without boundedness
    Let unbounded_sequence = ["f1", "2*f1", "3*f1", "4*f1"]
    Let weak_test = FunctionalAnalysis.test_weak_convergence(unbounded_sequence, "f0", weak_topology)
Catch Errors.BoundednessError as error:
    Display "Boundedness error: " joined with error.message
    Display "Weak convergence requires bounded sequences"
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Operator Norms**: Use matrix representations for finite-dimensional approximations
- **Spectral Computations**: Employ iterative methods for large eigenvalue problems
- **Weak Convergence**: Cache dual evaluations for efficiency
- **Distribution Operations**: Use symbolic computation where possible

## Best Practices

1. **Space Verification**: Always verify space axioms before analysis
2. **Operator Domain**: Carefully specify operator domains and ranges
3. **Convergence Types**: Distinguish between strong, weak, and weak* convergence
4. **Spectral Analysis**: Use appropriate methods based on operator type
5. **Sobolev Embeddings**: Check embedding conditions before application
6. **Distribution Theory**: Verify test function properties
