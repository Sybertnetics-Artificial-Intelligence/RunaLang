## Performance Considerations

- **σ-algebra Generation**: Use efficient set operations for large collections
- **Simple Function Approximation**: Cache approximations for repeated use
- **Product Measures**: Implement lazy evaluation for large product spaces
- **Convergence Theorems**: Use stopping criteria to avoid unnecessary computation

## Best Practices

1. **Measure Verification**: Always verify measure axioms before use
2. **Measurability Testing**: Check function measurability before integration
3. **Convergence Conditions**: Verify convergence theorem hypotheses
4. **Product Integration**: Use Tonelli before Fubini for non-negative functions
5. **Signed Measures**: Use Jordan decomposition for analysis
6. **Probability Applications**: Maintain probability measure normalization
