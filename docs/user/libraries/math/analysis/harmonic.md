## Performance Considerations

- **FFT Algorithms**: Use radix-2 FFT for signals with length 2ⁿ
- **Wavelet Transforms**: Choose wavelet family based on application requirements
- **Series Convergence**: Monitor convergence for truncated series
- **Distribution Operations**: Use symbolic computation for distributions

## Best Practices

1. **Fourier Series**: Check function regularity before computing series
2. **Transform Selection**: Match transform type to function/signal properties  
3. **Wavelet Choice**: Select wavelets based on time-frequency resolution needs
4. **Harmonic Functions**: Verify boundary condition compatibility
