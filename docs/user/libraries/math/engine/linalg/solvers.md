    Display "All solvers failed. Diagnostic information:"
    Display Solvers.format_diagnostic_info(diagnostic_info)
```

### Numerical Stability Monitoring

```runa
Note: Monitor numerical stability throughout solving process
Let stability_monitor be Solvers.create_stability_monitor([
    "condition_number_tracking",
    "pivot_growth_factor",
    "backward_error_estimate",
    "residual_monitoring"
])

Let monitored_solve be Solvers.solve_with_stability_monitoring(
    coefficient_matrix,
    right_hand_side,
    stability_monitor: stability_monitor,
    stability_threshold: 1e-12
)

Let stability_report be Solvers.get_stability_report(monitored_solve)

If Solvers.is_numerically_stable(stability_report):
    Display "Solution achieved with good numerical stability"
Otherwise:
    Let stability_issues be Solvers.identify_stability_issues(stability_report)
    Display "Numerical stability concerns detected:"
    For issue in stability_issues:
        Display "  - " joined with Solvers.describe_stability_issue(issue)
```

## Best Practices

### Solver Selection Guide

```runa
Note: Automatic solver selection based on matrix properties
Let solver_recommendation be Solvers.recommend_solver(coefficient_matrix, [
    "matrix_structure",
    "condition_number", 
    "sparsity_pattern",
    "problem_size",
    "accuracy_requirements"
])

Display "Recommended solver: " joined with Solvers.get_primary_recommendation(solver_recommendation)
Display "Alternative solvers: " joined with LinAlg.vector_to_string(
    Solvers.get_alternative_recommendations(solver_recommendation)
)

Let performance_estimate = Solvers.estimate_solver_performance(
    solver_recommendation,
    coefficient_matrix
)

Display "Estimated solve time: " joined with Solvers.get_time_estimate(performance_estimate) joined with "ms"
Display "Estimated memory usage: " joined with Solvers.get_memory_estimate(performance_estimate) joined with " MB"
```

The Linear System Solvers module provides comprehensive, high-performance algorithms for solving linear systems across the full spectrum of computational problems, from small dense systems to large-scale sparse problems in scientific computing and machine learning applications.
