## Best Practices

### Optimizer Selection
- **Adam**: General-purpose optimizer for most neural networks
- **AdamW**: When weight decay regularization is important
- **RMSprop**: For RNNs and problems with sparse gradients
- **SGD with momentum**: When computational resources are limited

### Learning Rate Strategy
- Start with adaptive methods (Adam) then fine-tune with SGD
- Use learning rate scheduling for better convergence
- Apply warm-up for large batch training
- Monitor loss curves and adjust accordingly

### Regularization
- Combine weight decay with batch normalization carefully
- Use gradient clipping for RNNs and deep networks
- Apply dropout scheduling during training
- Consider early stopping to prevent overfitting
