# Wavelet Transform and Multi-Resolution Analysis

The wavelet transform module provides comprehensive tools for multi-resolution signal analysis, offering both continuous and discrete wavelet transforms. Wavelets excel at analyzing signals with time-varying frequency content, making them ideal for transient analysis, signal compression, and feature extraction.

## Overview

Unlike Fourier transforms that provide frequency information but lose time localization, wavelet transforms provide both time and frequency information through multi-resolution analysis. This makes wavelets particularly suitable for analyzing non-stationary signals with localized features.

### Key Concepts

- **Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA)**: Decomposing signals into multiple resolution levels
- **Mother Wavelet**: The prototype wavelet function from which all others are derived
- **Scaling Function**: Complementary function for approximation coefficients
- **Dyadic Decomposition**: Powers-of-two scale progression
- **Perfect Reconstruction**: Exact signal recovery from wavelet coefficients
- **Vanishing Moments**: Number of polynomial moments the wavelet cancels

## Core Data Structures

### WaveletFunction

Complete specification of a wavelet family:

```runa
Type called "WaveletFunction":
    name as String                Note: wavelet identifier (e.g., "db4", "haar")
    family as String             Note: family name (daubechies, haar, biorthogonal)
