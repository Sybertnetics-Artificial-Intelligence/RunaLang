# Homological Algebra Module

The `math/algebra/homological` module provides comprehensive tools for homological algebra including chain complexes, exact sequences, derived functors, and spectral sequences. This module is essential for algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and advanced abstract algebra research.

## Quick Start

```runa
Import "math/algebra/homological" as Homological
Import "math/algebra/linear" as Linear

Note: Create and analyze chain complex
Let boundary_maps be [
    Linear.create_zero_map(dimension: 4),
    Linear.create_matrix([[1, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 1], [0, -1, -1]]),
    Linear.create_matrix([[1], [1], [1]])
]

Let chain_complex be Homological.create_chain_complex(boundary_maps)
Let homology_groups be Homological.compute_homology(chain_complex)

Display "Chain complex created with length " joined with boundary_maps.length()
For i from 0 to homology_groups.length() - 1:
    Display "H_" joined with i joined with " has rank " joined with homology_groups[i].rank
```

## Core Concepts

### Chain Complexes
Sequences of abelian groups or modules connected by homomorphisms such that the composition of consecutive maps is zero.

### Homology and Cohomology
Algebraic invariants that measure the "holes" or obstructions in mathematical structures.

### Exact Sequences
Fundamental tools for understanding relationships between algebraic objects.

### Derived Functors
Systematic way to measure how much a functor fails to be exact.

### Spectral Sequences
Computational tools for calculating homology and cohomology groups through successive approximations.
