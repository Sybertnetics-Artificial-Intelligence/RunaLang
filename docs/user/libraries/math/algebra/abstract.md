# Abstract Algebra Module

The `math/algebra/abstract` module provides fundamental algebraic structures and operations for abstract algebra including groups, rings, fields, modules, and their morphisms. This module forms the theoretical foundation for all algebraic computations in Runa.

## Quick Start

```runa
Import "math/algebra/abstract" as Abstract

Note: Create basic algebraic structures
Let cyclic_group be Abstract.create_cyclic_group(order: 6)
Let integer_ring be Abstract.create_integer_ring()
Let rational_field be Abstract.create_field("rational")

Note: Verify algebraic properties
Let is_abelian be Abstract.is_abelian(cyclic_group)
Let is_integral_domain be Abstract.is_integral_domain(integer_ring)
Let is_algebraically_closed be Abstract.is_algebraically_closed(rational_field)

Display "Cyclic group C6 is abelian: " joined with is_abelian
Display "Integer ring is integral domain: " joined with is_integral_domain
Display "Rational field is algebraically closed: " joined with is_algebraically_closed
```

## Core Concepts

### Algebraic Structures Hierarchy
Abstract algebra organizes mathematical structures by their operations and axioms:

1. **Magmas**: Sets with binary operations
2. **Semigroups**: Associative magmas  
3. **Monoids**: Semigroups with identity elements
4. **Groups**: Monoids with inverse elements
5. **Rings**: Structures with two operations (addition and multiplication)
6. **Fields**: Commutative rings with multiplicative inverses
7. **Modules**: Generalized vector spaces over rings
8. **Algebras**: Modules with additional multiplication structure
