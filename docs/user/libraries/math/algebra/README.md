## Best Practices

### Choosing Appropriate Representations
1. **Dense vs Sparse**: Use sparse representations for large, mostly-zero structures
2. **Exact vs Approximate**: Use exact arithmetic for theoretical work, approximate for numerical analysis
3. **Symbolic vs Numeric**: Choose based on whether exact symbolic manipulation is needed

### Error Handling and Validation
```runa
Note: Always validate algebraic structures
Process called "validate_group_axioms" that takes group as Group returns Boolean:
    Let associativity_check be Groups.check_associativity(group)
    Let identity_check be Groups.check_identity(group)
    Let inverse_check be Groups.check_inverses(group)
    
    Return associativity_check and identity_check and inverse_check
```

### Performance Optimization
```runa
Note: Use appropriate algorithms for problem size
Process called "choose_polynomial_algorithm" that takes:
    polynomials as List[Polynomial],
    problem_type as String
returns String:
    Let total_degree be Poly.compute_total_degree(polynomials)
    Let num_variables be Poly.count_variables(polynomials)
    
    If problem_type == "groebner_basis":
        If num_variables <= 3 and total_degree <= 10:
            Return "f4_algorithm"
        Otherwise:
            Return "f5_algorithm"
