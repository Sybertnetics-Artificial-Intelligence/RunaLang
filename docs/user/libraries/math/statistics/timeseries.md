    "horizon": "2"

    "method": "expanding"

## Error Handling and Validation

### Comprehensive Error Management
```runa
Note: Handle time series analysis errors
Try:
    Let insufficient_ts be [1.0, 2.0]  Note: Too short for ARIMA
    Let failed_arima be TimeSeries.fit_arima(insufficient_ts, [2, 1, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0])
Catch Errors.InsufficientData as error:
    Display "Time series length error: " joined with error.message
    Display "ARIMA models require sufficient data points for parameter estimation"

Try:
    Let non_convergent_order be [5, 2, 5]  Note: Over-parameterized
    Let failed_model be TimeSeries.fit_arima(ts_data, non_convergent_order, [0, 0, 0, 0])
Catch Errors.ConvergenceError as error:
    Display "Model convergence error: " joined with error.message
    Display "Consider reducing model complexity or increasing iterations"

Try:
    Let invalid_forecast_horizon be 100  Note: Too many periods ahead
    Let failed_forecast be TimeSeries.forecast_arima(arima_model, ts_data, invalid_forecast_horizon, [0.95])
Catch Errors.InvalidParameter as error:
    Display "Forecast horizon error: " joined with error.message
    Display "Forecast horizon should not exceed series length"
```

### Time Series Validation Framework
```runa
Process called "validate_time_series_analysis" that takes data as List[Float], analysis_type as String returns Dictionary[String, String]:
    Let validation_results be Dictionary[String, String]
    
    Note: Basic data validation
    Set validation_results["series_length"] to String(Length(data))
    Set validation_results["min_value"] to String(DescriptiveStats.calculate_range(data)["minimum"])
    Set validation_results["max_value"] to String(DescriptiveStats.calculate_range(data)["maximum"])
    
    Note: Check for missing values
    Let has_missing be check_missing_values_ts(data)
    Set validation_results["complete_series"] to String(not has_missing)
    
    Note: Stationarity assessment
    Let stationarity_check be TimeSeries.check_stationarity(data, ["adf"], 0.05)
    Set validation_results["stationary"] to String(stationarity_check["adf"]["conclusion"] == "stationary")
    
    Note: Seasonality detection
    Let seasonal_test be TimeSeries.test_seasonality(data, [4, 12])
    Set validation_results["seasonal_pattern"] to String(seasonal_test.has_seasonality)
    If seasonal_test.has_seasonality:
        Set validation_results["seasonal_period"] to String(seasonal_test.detected_period)
    
    Note: Analysis-specific validation
    If analysis_type == "arima":
        Let min_length be 20
        Set validation_results["sufficient_for_arima"] to String(Length(data) >= min_length)
        
        If not Boolean(validation_results["stationary"]):
            Set validation_results["needs_differencing"] to "true"
        Otherwise:
            Set validation_results["needs_differencing"] to "false"
    
    Otherwise if analysis_type == "seasonal_decomposition":
        Let min_cycles be 2
        Let seasonal_period be 4  Note: Default assumption
        If seasonal_test.has_seasonality:
            Set seasonal_period to seasonal_test.detected_period
        
        Let sufficient_for_decomp be Length(data) >= (min_cycles * seasonal_period)
        Set validation_results["sufficient_for_decomposition"] to String(sufficient_for_decomp)
        Set validation_results["min_required_length"] to String(min_cycles * seasonal_period)
    
    Note: Generate recommendations
    Let recommendations be []
    If has_missing:
        Call recommendations.append("Handle missing values before analysis")
    If analysis_type == "arima" and not Boolean(validation_results["stationary"]):
        Call recommendations.append("Apply differencing to achieve stationarity")
    If seasonal_test.has_seasonality and analysis_type == "arima":
        Call recommendations.append("Consider seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model")
    
    Set validation_results["recommendations"] to String(recommendations)
    Set validation_results["validation_complete"] to "true"
    
    Return validation_results

Note: Example validation
Let ts_validation be validate_time_series_analysis(ts_data, "arima")
Display "Time Series Analysis Validation:"
For Each key, value in ts_validation:
    Display "  " joined with key joined with ": " joined with value
