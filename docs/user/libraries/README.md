## Migration Guide

### From Basic Collections
```runa
# Old: Basic dictionary for caching
Let cache be dictionary with:

# New: LRU cache with automatic eviction
Let cache be cache.create_lru_cache with capacity as 100
```

### From External Libraries
- **Python collections.Counter** → Runa Multiset with enhanced analytics
- **Python heapq** → Runa Heap with object-oriented interface
- **NetworkX** → Runa Graph with 58+ algorithms
- **Python functools.lru_cache** → Runa LRU Cache with monitoring

## Best Practices

### Memory Management
1. **Choose appropriate capacities** for caches based on available memory
2. **Use TTL for temporal data** to prevent memory leaks
3. **Monitor cache hit rates** and adjust sizes accordingly
4. **Prefer immutable collections** (Frozen Set) when data doesn't change

### Performance Optimization
1. **Use bulk operations** when available for better performance
2. **Choose optimal data structures** based on access patterns
3. **Leverage statistics functions** for monitoring and optimization
4. **Consider cache hierarchies** for multi-level storage

### Error Handling
1. **Use safe variants** of operations that return success indicators
2. **Implement proper error checking** for operations that might fail
3. **Monitor collection health** using built-in statistics
4. **Plan for failure scenarios** with recovery mechanisms

## Contributing

### Adding New Collections
1. **Follow specification compliance**: Use Dictionary-based types only
2. **Implement comprehensive tests**: Cover all functionality and edge cases
3. **Provide complete documentation**: Include usage examples and performance characteristics
4. **Ensure production readiness**: No placeholders or incomplete implementations

### Code Review Standards
- ✅ 100% Runa specification compliance
