Note:
Mathematical Symbol Enforcement Demo
Demonstrates that mathematical symbols (+, -, *, /, <, >, <=, >=, !=) 
are ONLY allowed in mathematical contexts.

Valid Uses:
Process called "demonstrate_valid_math" returns Integer:
    Let x be 5
    Let y be 10
    Let sum be x plus y
    Let difference be x minus y
    Let product be x multiplied by y
    Let quotient be y divided by x
    
    If x is less than y:
        Return sum
    Otherwise if x is greater than y:
        Return difference
    Otherwise if x is equal to y:
        Return product
    Return quotient

Process called "demonstrate_comparisons" that takes a as Integer and b as Integer returns Boolean:
    Note: All of these are valid mathematical comparisons
    If a is greater than b:
        Return true
    If a is less than or equal to b:
        Return false
    If a is not equal to b:
        Return true
    Return false

Note: The following would cause compilation errors:

Note: ERROR: Mathematical symbols outside mathematical context
Note: Let name be "John" + "Doe"  -- ERROR: + only for math
Note: If status = "active":       -- ERROR: = not allowed, != only for numbers
Note: Let result be x * text      -- ERROR: * only for numeric types

Note: Instead, use proper Runa syntax:
Let name be String.concat with parts as list containing "John", "Doe"
If status is equal to "active":
Let result be String.repeat with str as text and count as x
