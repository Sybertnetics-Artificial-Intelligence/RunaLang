Note: Runa WebAssembly Example
Note: Simple program that demonstrates WebAssembly compilation

Process called "add_numbers" that takes a as Integer and b as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Simple addition function
    Return a + b

Process called "factorial" that takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Calculate factorial recursively
    If n <= 1:
        Return 1
    Else:
        Return n * factorial with n as n - 1

Process called "fibonacci" that takes n as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Calculate Fibonacci number
    If n <= 1:
        Return n
    Else:
        Return fibonacci with n as n - 1 + fibonacci with n as n - 2

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Main entry point for WebAssembly module
    Let result be add_numbers with a as 10 and b as 20
    Let fact_5 be factorial with n as 5
    Let fib_8 be fibonacci with n as 8
    
    Note: Return sum of all calculations
    Return result + fact_5 + fib_8
