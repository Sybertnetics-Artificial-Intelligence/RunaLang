Let c be create_counter()

For each fruit in fruits:
    Call increment with counter as c and key as fruit

Display "Apple count:" with message get_count with counter as c and key as "apple"
Display "Banana count:" with message get_count with counter as c and key as "banana"
Display "Cherry count:" with message get_count with counter as c and key as "cherry"

Call decrement with counter as c and key as "apple"
