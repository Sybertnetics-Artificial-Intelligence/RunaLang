Assertion Framework for Runa Testing

This module provides comprehensive assertion capabilities for testing Runa code.
Designed to be self-contained and free from circular dependencies to avoid
issues when testing the compiler and standard library themselves.

Key features and capabilities:
- Basic value comparison assertions (equals, not equals)
- Boolean condition assertions (true, false)
- Numeric comparison assertions (greater, less, ranges)
- String content assertions (contains, starts with, ends with)
- Collection assertions (contains, empty, size)
- Exception and error assertions
- Custom assertion messages and context
- Assertion statistics and reporting
- Integration with test runners
- Thread-safe assertion tracking
- Performance metrics for assertions
- Detailed failure diagnostics
