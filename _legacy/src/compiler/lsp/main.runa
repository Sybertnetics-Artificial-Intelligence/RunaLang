Note:
Runa LSP Server Main Entry Point

This is the main entry point for the Runa Language Server Protocol server.
It handles startup, configuration, and the main server loop.

Usage:
- Called by IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.) to start the language server
- Handles JSON-RPC communication over stdin/stdout
- Provides real-time language intelligence for Runa code

Note: LSP Server Configuration
Let default_config be LSPServerConfig with:
