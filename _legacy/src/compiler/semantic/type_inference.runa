Runa Hindley-Milner Type Inference Engine: Core Type System

This module implements the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm, which is the
foundation of modern type systems. It provides type inference, unification,
constraint solving, and generic type handling.

Key Features:
- Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm
- Type unification with occurs check
- Constraint solving for generics
- Type generalization and instantiation
- Performance optimization with caching
- Comprehensive error reporting
