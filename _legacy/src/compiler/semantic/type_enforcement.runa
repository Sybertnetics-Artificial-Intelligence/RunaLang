Note:
Runa Type Enforcement: Three-Mode System

This module implements the three-mode type enforcement system:
- Strict Mode: All types required, compile-time errors
- Gradual Mode: Types optional, warnings for issues  
- Flexible Mode: Types ignored, runtime checking only

Key Features:
- Simple mode detection and switching
- Context-aware error reporting
- Performance optimization based on mode
- Target language adaptation support
