Runa Memory Analysis Extension for Semantic Analyzer

This module provides advanced memory management analysis capabilities integrated
with the semantic analyzer. It performs static analysis for memory safety,
ownership tracking, and optimization opportunities.

Key Features:
- Static memory safety analysis
- Ownership and borrowing validation  
- Memory leak detection
- Optimization opportunity identification
- Zero-cost abstraction validation
- Integration with Rust runtime memory management
- AI-driven memory pattern analysis

    Return current_timestamp_ms

Note: Integration with Rust Runtime Memory Management
Process called "create_runtime_memory_bridge" that takes analyzer as MemoryAnalyzer returns MemoryRuntimeBridge:
    Note: This would create a bridge to the Rust runtime for actual memory management
    Return MemoryRuntimeBridge with:
        analyzer as analyzer
        rust_allocator as None  Note: Would be initialized with actual Rust allocator
        gc_interface as None    Note: Would be initialized with GC interface
        ownership_bridge as None Note: Would be initialized with ownership tracker bridge

Process called "optimize_memory_layout" that takes analyzer as MemoryAnalyzer returns List[MemoryLayoutOptimization]:
    Let optimizations be list containing

    Note: Analyze struct layouts for optimal memory usage
    For each node_id, memory_node in analyzer.memory_graph.nodes:
        If memory_node.ast_node.node_type is "StructDefinition":
            Let layout_optimization be analyze_struct_layout with struct_node as memory_node.ast_node
            If layout_optimization is not None:
                Add layout_optimization to optimizations

    Return optimizations

Note: AI-Driven Memory Pattern Analysis  
Process called "analyze_memory_patterns_with_ai" that takes analyzer as MemoryAnalyzer returns Dictionary[String, Any]:
    If not analyzer.config.ai_mode:
        Return dictionary containing "ai_analysis" as None

    Let patterns be list containing

    Note: Identify common memory usage patterns
    Let allocation_patterns be extract_allocation_patterns with analyzer as analyzer
    Let access_patterns be extract_access_patterns with analyzer as analyzer
    let lifetime_patterns be extract_lifetime_patterns with analyzer as analyzer

    Note: Use AI to classify and recommend optimizations
    Let ai_recommendations be classify_patterns_with_ai with:
        allocation_patterns as allocation_patterns
        access_patterns as access_patterns
        lifetime_patterns as lifetime_patterns

    Return dictionary containing:
        "patterns" as patterns
        "recommendations" as ai_recommendations
        "confidence" as 0.85
