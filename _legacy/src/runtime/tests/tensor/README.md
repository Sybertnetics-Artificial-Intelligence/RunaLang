# Tensor Runtime Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for Runa's Tensor Runtime System, validating all components from basic tensor operations to advanced automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.

## Test Structure

### Integration Tests (`test_tensor_runtime_integration.runa`)

End-to-end tests that validate the entire tensor runtime system working together:

- **Basic Tensor Operations**: Creation, initialization, and basic arithmetic
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Gradient computation and backpropagation
- **Graph Optimization**: Computational graph fusion and optimization
- **Device Management**: Memory allocation, device placement, and cross-device transfers
- **Neural Network Operations**: Activation functions, convolution, and matrix operations
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Throughput and latency measurements

### Unit Tests (`test_tensor_operations.runa`)

Isolated tests for individual tensor operations with edge cases:

- **Tensor Creation & Initialization**: Different shapes, data types, and initialization patterns
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, divide with edge cases (division by zero)
- **Mathematical Operations**: Exponential, logarithm, trigonometric, square root, power
- **Reduction Operations**: Sum, mean, max, min along different axes
- **Matrix Operations**: Matrix multiplication, transpose, dot product
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, GELU, Softmax

```

## Dependencies

The tests depend on the following tensor runtime components:

- `tensor_runtime.runa` - Core tensor infrastructure
- `autograd_engine.runa` - Automatic differentiation
- `graph_optimizer.runa` - Computational graph optimization
- `device_manager.runa` - Device and memory management
- `tensor_compiler_integration.runa` - GPU compiler integration
- `tensor_ops.runa` - Tensor operations library

## Host Implementation Notes

The tests use FFI boundaries for performance-critical operations that are implemented in the host runtime (Rust). Key external functions include:

- `get_current_time()` - High-resolution timing
- `get_memory_usage()` - Memory consumption tracking

These functions must be implemented in the Rust host runtime for tests to execute correctly.

## Extending the Tests

To add new tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Add new test functions to `test_tensor_operations.runa`
2. **Integration Tests**: Add new test scenarios to `test_tensor_runtime_integration.runa`
3. **Performance Tests**: Add new benchmarks to the performance benchmark section

Follow the existing pattern of:
- Try/catch error handling
- Detailed validation with tolerance checks
- Clear error messages
- Performance timing
