Note: Test boolean type consistency in conditional expressions

Process called "test_conditions" that takes x as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Test If with comparison (should generate i1)
    If x is greater than 5:
        Return 1
    End If

    Note: Test While with length_of (integer converted to boolean)
    Let list be a list containing 1, 2, 3
    While length of list is greater than 0:
        Return 2
    End While

    Return 0
End Process

Process called "main" that takes x as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be test_conditions(x)
    Return result
End Process
