Note: Test more complex boolean conditions

Process called "test_complex" that takes x as Integer returns Integer:
    Note: Test multiple conditions
    If x is greater than 5:
        If x is less than 10:
            Return 1
        End If
    End If

    Note: Test while with simple condition
    Let counter be 0
    While counter is less than 3:
        Set counter to counter plus 1
    End While

    Return counter
End Process

Process called "main" that takes x as Integer returns Integer:
    Return test_complex(x)
End Process
