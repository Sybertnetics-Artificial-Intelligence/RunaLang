Process called main returns Integer:
    Note: Integer literals and variables
    Let x be 42
    Let y be -17

    Note: Basic arithmetic operators
    Let sum be x plus y
    Let diff be x minus y
    Let product be x multiplied by 2
    Let quotient be x divided by 2

    Note: Comparison operators
    If x is greater than y:
        Let comparison_result be 1
    Otherwise:
        Let comparison_result be 0
    End If

    Note: Let variable declarations
    Let message be "Core features working"

    Note: While loops
    Let counter be 0
    While counter is less than 3:
        Set counter to counter plus 1
    End While

    Note: Return statements
    Return counter
End Process

Note: Function definitions and calls
Process called test_function that takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Return a plus b
End Process
