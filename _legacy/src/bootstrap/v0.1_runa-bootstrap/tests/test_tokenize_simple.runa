Type called "Token":
    token_type as String
    line as Integer
    column as Integer
End Type

Process called "tokenize" that takes input as String returns List:
    Let tokens be a list containing nothing
    Let position be 0
    
    While position is less than length of input:
        Let char be input at index position
        
        If char is equal to "(":
            Let token be a value of type Token with
                token_type as "LeftParen",
                line as 1,
                column as position
            Add token to end of tokens
        End If
        
        Set position to position plus 1
    End While
    
    Return tokens
End Process
