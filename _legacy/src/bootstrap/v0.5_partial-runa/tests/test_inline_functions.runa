Process called "min" that takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a
    If b is less than a:
        Set result to b
    End If
    Return result
End Process

Process called "max" that takes a as Integer, b as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be a
    If b is greater than a:
        Set result to b
    End If
    Return result
End Process

Process called "abs" that takes value as Integer returns Integer:
    Let result be value
    If value is less than 0:
        Set result to 0 minus value
    End If
    Return result
End Process

Process called "main" returns Integer:
    Note: Test math functions
    
    Let a be 10
    Let b be 20
    Let min_val be min(a, b)
    Let max_val be max(a, b)
    Let abs_val be abs(0 minus 15)
    
    Note: min(10, 20) = 10, max(10, 20) = 20, abs(-15) = 15
    Note: Sum should be 10 + 20 + 15 = 45
    Return min_val plus max_val plus abs_val
End Process
