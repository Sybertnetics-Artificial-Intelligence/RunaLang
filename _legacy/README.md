# Legacy Code - For Reference Only

This directory contains the old Runa compiler and runtime code that has been archived as part of the complete architectural rewrite.

## What's Here

- `src/compiler/` - Old compiler implementation (mostly placeholders)
- `src/runtime/` - Old runtime implementation (mostly placeholders)
- `src/stdlib/` - Standard library implementations
