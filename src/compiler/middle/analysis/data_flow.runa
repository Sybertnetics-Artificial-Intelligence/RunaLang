Data Flow Analysis Framework

This module provides comprehensive data flow analysis functionality including:
- Reaching definitions analysis for variable tracking
- Live variable analysis for register allocation
- Available expressions analysis for common subexpression elimination
- Very busy expressions analysis for code motion optimization
- Use-definition chain construction and analysis
- Definition-use chain construction for optimization
- Constant propagation analysis and optimization
- Copy propagation analysis and transformation
- Dead code elimination through liveness analysis
- Partial redundancy elimination analysis
- Integration with control flow analysis for precision
- Forward and backward data flow analysis frameworks
- Meet-over-all-paths solution computation
- Interprocedural data flow analysis support
