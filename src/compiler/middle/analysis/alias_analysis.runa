Pointer Alias Analysis System

This module provides comprehensive alias analysis functionality including:
- Points-to analysis for pointer relationships
- Alias set computation and maintenance
- Memory location disambiguation
- Flow-sensitive and flow-insensitive analysis modes
- Context-sensitive alias analysis
- Escape analysis for memory optimization
- Memory safety analysis and validation
- Reference counting optimization analysis
- Memory access pattern analysis
- Integration with memory management optimizations
- Support for complex data structures and nested pointers
- Interprocedural alias analysis
- Integration with AOTT memory optimizations
- Memory corruption detection and prevention
