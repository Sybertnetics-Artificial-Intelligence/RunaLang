Dependency Analysis and Tracking System

This module provides comprehensive dependency analysis functionality including:
- Data dependency analysis and tracking
- Control dependency identification and modeling
- Memory dependency analysis for optimization
- Loop dependency analysis for parallelization
- Function dependency analysis for optimization
- Module dependency tracking and resolution
- Cross-procedure dependency analysis
- Dependency graph construction and analysis
- Dependency-based optimization enabling
- Parallel execution dependency validation
- Resource dependency tracking
- Integration with scheduling optimizations
- Dependency violation detection and prevention
- Dependency-aware code transformations
