HIR to MIR Lowering Transformations

This module provides comprehensive HIR to MIR lowering functionality including:
- High-level construct decomposition to middle-level operations
- Complex expression lowering to simpler operations
- Control flow construct lowering and normalization
- Memory allocation and deallocation lowering
- Function call lowering and ABI adaptation
- Exception handling construct lowering
- Generic construct instantiation and lowering
- Pattern matching lowering to conditional logic
- Complex data structure access lowering
- Operator overloading resolution and lowering
- Type conversion and coercion lowering
- Closure capture and environment lowering
- Async/await construct lowering
- Integration with type system for correct lowering
