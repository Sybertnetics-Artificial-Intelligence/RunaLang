Type Monomorphization System

This module provides comprehensive monomorphization functionality including:
- Generic type instantiation for concrete types
- Polymorphic function monomorphization
- Type parameter substitution and resolution
- Monomorphization of complex generic data structures
- Trait object monomorphization and devirtualization
- Higher-kinded type monomorphization
- Recursive type monomorphization handling
- Monomorphization dependency tracking
- Code size optimization through selective monomorphization
- Integration with specialization system
- Monomorphization cache and reuse management
- Cross-module monomorphization coordination
- Runtime type information generation
- Integration with AOTT type-based optimizations
