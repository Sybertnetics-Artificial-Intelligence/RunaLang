Generic Specialization System

This module provides comprehensive generic specialization functionality including:
- Generic function specialization for specific types
- Generic type instantiation and specialization
- Compile-time parameter specialization
- Profile-guided specialization decisions
- Specialization cost-benefit analysis
- Template instantiation and optimization
- Trait/interface specialization
- Conditional specialization based on type properties
- Specialization cache management
- Integration with monomorphization process
- Recursive generic specialization
- Cross-module specialization coordination
- Specialization for AOTT optimization enablement
- Runtime specialization decision support
