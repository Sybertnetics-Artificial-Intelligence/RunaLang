Static Optimization Passes Framework

This module provides comprehensive static optimization functionality including:
- Dead code elimination and unreachable code removal
- Constant folding and propagation optimizations
- Common subexpression elimination
- Copy propagation and redundancy elimination
- Loop optimizations (unrolling, invariant hoisting, fusion)
- Inlining and function specialization
- Strength reduction and algebraic simplifications
- Peephole optimizations and instruction combining
- Control flow optimizations and branch elimination
- Memory access optimizations and locality improvements
- Vectorization and parallelization transformations
- Profile-guided optimization integration
- Integration with AOTT optimization hints
- Cross-procedure optimization enablement
