Note:
Mid-Level Intermediate Representation (MIR) Builder Module

This module provides comprehensive MIR construction capabilities for the Runa
compiler. It transforms High-Level IR (HIR) into a mid-level intermediate 
representation that normalizes control flow, converts to SSA form, and prepares
for optimization passes. MIR represents a lower-level abstraction suitable for
aggressive optimization while maintaining semantic clarity.

Core responsibilities:
- HIR to MIR transformation with control flow normalization
- Static Single Assignment (SSA) form conversion
- Basic block generation and control flow graph construction
- Variable lifetime analysis and phi node insertion
- Exception handling lowering and cleanup code generation
- Function call lowering and parameter passing conventions
