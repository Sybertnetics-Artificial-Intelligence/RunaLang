Note:
Mid-Level Intermediate Representation (MIR) Optimizer Module

This module provides comprehensive static optimization capabilities for MIR code
in the Runa compiler. It implements a wide range of optimization passes that
operate on the MIR representation to improve code performance, reduce code size,
and eliminate redundancies while preserving program semantics.

Core responsibilities:
- Dead code elimination and unreachable code removal
- Constant folding and propagation across basic blocks
- Common subexpression elimination with value numbering
- Loop optimizations including invariant code motion
- Inlining decisions and function call optimization
- Control flow simplification and branch optimization
