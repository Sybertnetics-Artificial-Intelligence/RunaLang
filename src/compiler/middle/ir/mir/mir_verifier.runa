Note:
Mid-Level Intermediate Representation (MIR) Verifier Module

This module provides comprehensive verification capabilities for MIR code in the
Runa compiler. It validates the structural and semantic correctness of MIR
programs, ensuring that optimizations and transformations maintain program
integrity and that the MIR representation is well-formed for further processing.

Core responsibilities:
- SSA form property verification and phi node validation
- Control flow graph integrity checking
- Type system consistency verification
- Memory safety and aliasing validation
- Exception handling correctness verification
- Debug information consistency checking
