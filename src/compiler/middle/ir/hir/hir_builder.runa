Note:
High-Level Intermediate Representation (HIR) Builder Module

This module provides comprehensive HIR construction capabilities for the Runa 
compiler. It transforms the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into a high-level 
intermediate representation that preserves semantic information while beginning 
the lowering process toward executable code.

Core responsibilities:
- AST to HIR transformation with semantic preservation
- Type information attachment and propagation
- Control flow graph construction and analysis
- Symbol resolution and binding
- Scope management and variable lifetime tracking
- Function signature analysis and call site resolution
