Note:
High-Level Intermediate Representation (HIR) Visitor and Traversal Module

This module provides comprehensive visitor patterns and traversal mechanisms for
HIR nodes in the Runa compiler. It implements multiple visitor interfaces that
enable systematic analysis, transformation, and processing of HIR trees while
maintaining type safety and providing flexible traversal strategies.

Core responsibilities:
- Visitor pattern implementation for HIR node traversal
- Tree walking strategies (depth-first, breadth-first, post-order)
- Transformation visitor for HIR node modifications  
- Analysis visitor for collecting information without modification
- Pattern matching support for compiler analysis passes
- Immutable and mutable visitor interfaces
