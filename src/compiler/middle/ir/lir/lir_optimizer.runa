Note:
Low-Level Intermediate Representation (LIR) Optimizer Module

This module provides comprehensive low-level optimization capabilities for LIR code
in the Runa compiler. It implements machine-oriented optimizations that operate
on virtual registers, memory operations, and instruction sequences to improve
performance while preparing for register allocation and final code generation.
These optimizations are target-aware and consider machine-specific costs and constraints.

Core responsibilities:
- Peephole optimization and instruction combining
- Register allocation preparation and virtual register optimization
- Instruction scheduling for pipeline efficiency
- Memory access optimization and load/store combining
- Branch optimization and jump threading
- Target-specific optimizations and instruction selection refinement
