Note:
Low-Level Intermediate Representation (LIR) Builder Module

This module provides comprehensive functionality for constructing LIR from MIR in
the Runa compiler. It handles the lowering of mid-level representations to
machine-oriented code suitable for register allocation and final code generation.
The builder transforms abstract SSA form into concrete machine instructions while
maintaining optimization opportunities and preparing for target-specific optimizations.

Core responsibilities:
- MIR to LIR transformation with instruction selection
- Register allocation preparation and virtual register assignment
- Control flow lowering to machine-level branches and jumps
- Memory operation lowering with addressing mode selection
- Call sequence generation with calling convention adherence
- Exception handling lowering to machine-level constructs
