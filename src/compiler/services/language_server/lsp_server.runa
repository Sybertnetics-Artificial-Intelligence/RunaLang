Language Server Protocol (LSP) Server Implementation

This module provides comprehensive LSP server functionality including:
- LSP protocol initialization and capability negotiation
- Message handling and routing (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- Client-server communication management
- Request/response lifecycle management
- Notification handling and broadcasting
- Server lifecycle management (initialize, shutdown, exit)
- Workspace management and file synchronization
- Configuration management and dynamic updates
- Plugin and extension support
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Multi-client support and session management
- AOTT integration for real-time compilation feedback
