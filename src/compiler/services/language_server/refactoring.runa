Code Refactoring and Transformation Services

This module provides comprehensive refactoring functionality including:
- Symbol renaming with scope analysis and conflict detection
- Extract method/function from selected code blocks
- Extract variable/constant from expressions
- Inline variable/function/method operations
- Move symbol operations (class, function, module)
- Safe delete operations with reference checking
- Change signature operations (parameters, return types)
- Convert between different code patterns
- Organize imports and remove unused imports
- Code structure transformations
- Automated refactoring suggestions
- Refactoring preview and validation
- AOTT-aware performance-preserving refactorings
