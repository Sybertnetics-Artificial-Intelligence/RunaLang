Note:
void_primitive.runa - Zero-Dependency Void/Unit Type Primitives

This module provides the foundational unit type operations.
The unit type represents "no value" and is used for procedures with no return value.
These primitives have ZERO dependencies and compile to minimal or no machine instructions.

@Reasoning:
- Unit type is a zero-sized type that carries no runtime information
- Used for procedures that perform side effects but return no value
- No actual assembly needed for most operations (compile-time only)
- Essential for type system completeness

@Implementation:
- Most operations are no-ops at runtime
- Type exists for compile-time type checking
- Zero memory footprint
- No runtime overhead

@Performance_Hints:
- Zero-cost abstraction - no runtime overhead
- Optimized away by compiler in most cases
- Used for type safety without performance penalty
- No memory allocation or operations needed
