Memory Layout Compiler Integration Layer

This module maps memory layout operations from the parser to the appropriate
functions in the standard library. It handles type layout resolution, memory
optimization hints, compile-time layout calculations, and IR generation for
runtime memory management.

Key responsibilities:
- Map type declarations to memory layout calculations in stdlib
- Resolve memory layout requirements based on type information
- Perform compile-time layout optimization and validation
- Generate IR/bytecode for runtime memory layout operations
- Handle platform-specific memory alignment requirements
- Support memory optimization hints (packing, alignment, cache-friendly)
- Validate memory layout compatibility and requirements
- Handle struct field reordering and padding calculations
