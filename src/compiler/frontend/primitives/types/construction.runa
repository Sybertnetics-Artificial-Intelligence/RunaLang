Type Construction Primitives

This module provides fundamental type construction operations for all Runa primitive types.

Key features and capabilities:
- Factory methods for creating primitive type instances
- Default value construction for all types
- Copy and clone operations for immutable types
- Builder patterns for complex type construction
- Memory-efficient construction techniques
- Type-safe construction with validation
- Performance-optimized creation routines
- Zero-allocation construction where possible
- Integration with compiler type system
- Error handling for invalid construction
- Thread-safe construction operations
- Resource management for constructed objects
:End Note

Note: Using only core primitives - no stdlib imports

Note: Default Value Construction - returns zero/null values for each type
