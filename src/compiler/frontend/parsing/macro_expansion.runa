Macro System and Template Expansion

This module provides comprehensive macro functionality including:
- Macro definition parsing and validation
- Template expansion with parameter substitution
- Recursive macro expansion with cycle detection
- Hygienic macro system preventing variable capture
- Context-aware macro expansion
- Integration with both natural and technical syntax modes
- Performance optimized macro processing
- Macro debugging and introspection utilities
