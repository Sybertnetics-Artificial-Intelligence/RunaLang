Memory Safety and Borrow Checking System

This module provides comprehensive borrow checking functionality including:
- Memory safety analysis for both syntax modes
- Ownership tracking and transfer validation
- Mutable and immutable borrow conflict detection
- Lifetime analysis for borrowed references
- Move semantics validation and enforcement
- Integration with Runa's memory management system
- Performance optimized borrow checking algorithms
- Comprehensive error reporting with suggestions
