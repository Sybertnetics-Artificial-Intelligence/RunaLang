Profiling Hook Insertion System

This module provides comprehensive profiling hook functionality including:
- Strategic profiling point insertion in bytecode
- Function entry/exit profiling instrumentation
- Loop iteration counting and hotspot detection
- Branch taken/not-taken profiling support
- Memory allocation profiling instrumentation
- Call site profiling for optimization decisions
- Type profiling for speculation optimization
- Execution frequency counting and analysis
- Low-overhead profiling hook implementation
- Conditional profiling activation support
- Profile data collection and aggregation
- Integration with AOTT tier promotion decisions
- Runtime profiling overhead management
- Profile-guided optimization feedback integration
