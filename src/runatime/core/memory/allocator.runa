Memory Allocator Module

This module provides comprehensive memory allocation services for the Runa runtime including:
- Heap allocation with multiple strategies (first-fit, best-fit, buddy system)
- Stack allocation with overflow protection
- Arena allocation for temporary memory
- Slab allocation for fixed-size objects
- NUMA-aware allocation for performance
- Memory alignment and padding
- Allocation tracking and statistics
- Out-of-memory handling and recovery
- Memory pressure monitoring
- Allocation profiling and optimization
- Lock-free allocation for concurrency
- Memory tagging for debugging
- Allocation policies and limits
- Custom allocator registration
- Memory defragmentation
