Synchronization Barriers for Phase Coordination

This module provides comprehensive barrier functionality including:
- Thread barriers for phase synchronization
- Reusable barriers with automatic reset
- Timed barrier operations with timeout
- Priority-aware barrier queuing
- Hierarchical barriers for multi-level coordination
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers
- Performance monitoring and synchronization analysis
