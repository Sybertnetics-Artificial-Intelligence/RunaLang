Condition Variables for Thread Signaling

This module provides comprehensive condition variable functionality including:
- Standard condition variables with mutex integration
- Timed wait operations with timeout support
- Broadcast and signal notifications
- Spurious wakeup handling
- Priority-aware condition variables
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers
- Performance monitoring and wait analysis
