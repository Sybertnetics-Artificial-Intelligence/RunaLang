Semaphores for Resource Management

This module provides comprehensive semaphore functionality including:
- Counting semaphores with configurable limits
- Binary semaphores for mutual exclusion
- Timed semaphore operations
- Priority-aware semaphore queuing
- Named semaphores for inter-process communication
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers
- Performance monitoring and resource tracking
