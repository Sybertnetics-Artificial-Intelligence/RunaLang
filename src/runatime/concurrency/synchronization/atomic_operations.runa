Lock-Free Atomic Operations

This module provides comprehensive atomic operations including:
- Compare-and-swap (CAS) operations
- Atomic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, etc.)
- Atomic bitwise operations
- Memory ordering and synchronization primitives
- Atomic pointers and references
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers
- Performance monitoring for lock-free algorithms
