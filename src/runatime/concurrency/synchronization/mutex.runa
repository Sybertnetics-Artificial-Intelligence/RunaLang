Mutual Exclusion Locks for Thread Synchronization

This module provides comprehensive mutex functionality including:
- Standard mutex with blocking and non-blocking acquisition
- Recursive mutex supporting multiple acquisitions by same thread
- Timed mutex with timeout-based acquisition attempts
- Adaptive mutex with spinning and blocking strategies
- Fair mutex preventing thread starvation
- Reader-writer mutex for shared/exclusive access patterns
- Priority-aware mutex respecting thread priorities
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers for optimal performance
- Deadlock detection and prevention mechanisms
- NUMA-aware mutex allocation and affinity
- Performance monitoring and contention analysis
- Lock-free alternatives for high-performance scenarios
