Asynchronous I/O Operations

This module provides comprehensive async I/O functionality including:
- Non-blocking file I/O operations
- Asynchronous network I/O
- I/O completion notification
- Buffer management for async operations
- I/O multiplexing (select, poll, epoll)
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers
- Performance monitoring and I/O analysis
