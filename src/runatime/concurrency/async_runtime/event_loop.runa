Event Loop Implementation for Asynchronous Execution

This module provides comprehensive event loop functionality including:
- Single-threaded and multi-threaded event loops
- Event registration and dispatching
- Timer and I/O event handling
- Priority-based event scheduling
- Event loop lifecycle management
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers
- Performance monitoring and event analysis
