Future/Promise Execution Engine

This module provides comprehensive future execution functionality including:
- Future creation and chaining
- Promise resolution and rejection
- Async/await pattern support
- Future combinators (map, flatMap, etc.)
- Error handling and propagation
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers
- Performance monitoring and future analysis
