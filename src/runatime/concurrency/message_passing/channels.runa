Channel Implementation for Message Passing

This module provides comprehensive channel functionality including:
- MPSC (Multi-Producer Single-Consumer) channels
- MPMC (Multi-Producer Multi-Consumer) channels
- Bounded and unbounded channels
- Synchronous and asynchronous channels
- Channel selection and multiplexing
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers
- Performance monitoring and message analysis
