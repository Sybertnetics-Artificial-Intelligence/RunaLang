Actor Model Implementation

This module provides comprehensive actor model functionality including:
- Actor creation and lifecycle management
- Message processing and behavior definition
- Actor supervision and fault tolerance
- Actor state management and isolation
- Actor addressing and discovery
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers
- Performance monitoring and actor analysis
