Thread-Local Storage Management

This module provides comprehensive thread-local storage functionality including:
- Thread-local variable allocation and management
- Type-safe thread-local storage with automatic cleanup
- Thread-local memory pools and caching
- Inheritance of thread-local data across thread creation
- Thread-local counters and statistics
- NUMA-aware thread-local allocation
- Integration with AOTT execution tiers for optimal performance
- Thread-local random number generators and seeds
- Thread-local error handling and logging contexts
- Lazy initialization and deferred allocation
- Thread-local profiling and debugging support
- Cross-platform thread-local storage abstraction
