- Garbage collection performance analysis and tuning
- Memory pool efficiency analysis and optimization
- Memory access pattern profiling for cache optimization
- Memory safety validation and bounds checking
- Memory corruption detection and debugging support
- Integration with AOTT system for memory-aware optimizations
- Real-time memory monitoring and alerting
- Memory usage forecasting and capacity planning
- Cross-platform memory analysis and reporting
