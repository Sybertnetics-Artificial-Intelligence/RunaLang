Garbage Collection Tuning and Optimization System

This module provides comprehensive GC tuning functionality including:
- Garbage collection algorithm selection and configuration
- GC timing optimization and pause minimization
- Generation sizing and heap organization tuning
- GC trigger threshold optimization
- Concurrent and parallel GC configuration
- Memory pressure-based GC scheduling
- Application-specific GC policy adaptation
- GC performance monitoring and analysis
- Automatic GC parameter adjustment
- Integration with AOTT system for GC-aware optimizations
- Real-time GC performance tracking
- GC pause analysis and optimization recommendations
- Cross-platform GC behavior normalization
- Memory allocation pattern-based GC tuning
