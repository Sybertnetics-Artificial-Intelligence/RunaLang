- Multi-dimensional threshold optimization (frequency, time, memory)
- Workload-specific threshold personalization and learning
- Resource-aware threshold scaling for different hardware configurations
- Real-time threshold tuning based on optimization effectiveness
- Statistical analysis of threshold impact on compilation decisions
- Cross-application threshold knowledge transfer and optimization
