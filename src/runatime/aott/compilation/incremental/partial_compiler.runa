Note:
AOTT Incremental Partial Compilation Module

This module implements partial recompilation for the AOTT incremental compilation
system. It coordinates selective recompilation of only the compilation units
affected by changes, using dependency analysis and change impact assessment
to minimize compilation overhead. The partial compiler integrates with all
optimization tiers and maintains compilation consistency across incremental builds.

Core responsibilities:
- Partial recompilation planning based on change analysis
- Incremental optimization with dependency-aware invalidation
- Cross-tier compilation coordination for affected units
- Compilation session state management and recovery
- Integration testing of incrementally compiled components
- Performance optimization for incremental compilation workflows
