Note:
AOTT Incremental Compilation Change Detection Module

This module implements change detection for the AOTT incremental compilation
system. It tracks modifications to source code, dependencies, and compilation
artifacts to determine the minimal set of recompilation required. The detector
uses sophisticated hashing, dependency tracking, and profile-aware change
analysis to optimize compilation speed while maintaining correctness.

Core responsibilities:
- Source code change detection with fine-grained granularity
- Dependency-based change propagation analysis
- Compilation artifact invalidation tracking
- Profile data change impact analysis
- Cross-tier compilation invalidation coordination
- Change impact estimation for compilation planning
