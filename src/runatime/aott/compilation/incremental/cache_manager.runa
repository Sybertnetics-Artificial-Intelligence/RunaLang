Note:
AOTT Incremental Compilation Cache Management Module

This module implements comprehensive cache management for the AOTT incremental
compilation system. It manages caches for compilation artifacts, analysis results,
profile data, and optimization metadata across all compilation tiers. The cache
manager provides intelligent eviction policies, cache coherency, and performance
optimization to minimize recompilation overhead while maintaining correctness.

Core responsibilities:
- Multi-tier compilation artifact caching with tier-aware policies
- Analysis result caching for dependency tracking and optimization
- Profile data caching with temporal validity management
- Cache coherency maintenance across concurrent compilation sessions
- Intelligent cache eviction based on usage patterns and compilation impact
- Cache persistence and recovery for compilation session continuity
