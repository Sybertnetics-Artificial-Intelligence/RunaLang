Note:
AOTT Incremental Compilation Dependency Tracking Module

This module implements dependency tracking for the AOTT incremental compilation
system. It maintains comprehensive dependency graphs between source code entities,
compilation artifacts, and optimization assumptions to enable precise incremental
recompilation. The tracker supports fine-grained dependency analysis and
efficient invalidation propagation across compilation tiers.

Core responsibilities:
- Compilation dependency graph construction and maintenance
- Fine-grained dependency relationship tracking between entities
- Invalidation propagation through dependency chains
- Cross-tier dependency relationship management
- Profile data dependency tracking and validation
- Optimization assumption dependency analysis
