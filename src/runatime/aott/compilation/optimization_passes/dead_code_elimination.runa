Note:
AOTT Dead Code Elimination Optimization Pass Module

This module implements dead code elimination for the AOTT compilation system.
It removes instructions, basic blocks, and entire functions that cannot affect
program output, reducing code size and improving cache utilization. The pass
operates across all optimization tiers with increasing aggressiveness, using
liveness analysis, reachability analysis, and profile information to guide
elimination decisions.

Core responsibilities:
- Dead instruction elimination using liveness analysis
- Unreachable code removal through reachability analysis
- Dead variable elimination in SSA form
- Speculative dead code elimination with deoptimization guards
- Profile-guided aggressive elimination
- Cross-tier dead code information propagation
