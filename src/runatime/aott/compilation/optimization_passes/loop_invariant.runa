Note:
AOTT Loop Invariant Code Motion Optimization Pass Module

This module implements loop invariant code motion for the AOTT compilation system.
It identifies computations within loops that produce the same result on every
iteration and moves them outside the loop to reduce redundant computation. The
pass uses loop analysis, dominance information, and alias analysis to ensure
safe code motion while maximizing performance benefits.

Core responsibilities:
- Loop-invariant expression identification using dataflow analysis
- Safe code motion using dominance and post-dominance analysis
- Memory operation hoisting with alias analysis validation
- Speculative invariant hoisting with deoptimization guards
- Profile-guided hoisting prioritization
- Cross-tier loop optimization information preservation
