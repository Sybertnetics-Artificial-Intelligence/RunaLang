Note:
AOTT Function Inlining Optimization Pass Module

This module implements function inlining optimization for the AOTT compilation
system. It replaces function calls with the actual function body when beneficial,
reducing call overhead and enabling further optimizations. The pass uses
sophisticated cost-benefit analysis, considers profile information, and adapts
its strategy based on optimization tier and speculation capabilities.

Core responsibilities:
- Inlining cost-benefit analysis with execution frequency weighting
- Call site analysis and function body preparation for inlining
- Recursive inlining with cycle detection and depth limits
- Speculative inlining with type and value speculation
- Profile-guided inlining decisions based on hotness data
- Cross-tier inlining information preservation and refinement
