Note:
AOTT Auto-Vectorization Optimization Pass Module

This module implements automatic vectorization for the AOTT compilation system.
It analyzes loops and straight-line code to identify opportunities for SIMD
(Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimization, transforming scalar operations
into vector operations for improved performance. The pass considers target
architecture capabilities, data dependencies, and alignment requirements.

Core responsibilities:
- Loop vectorization with dependency analysis and safety verification
- SLP (Superword Level Parallelism) vectorization for straight-line code
- Target-specific vector instruction selection and optimization
- Speculative vectorization with runtime validation guards
- Profile-guided vectorization based on execution hotness
- Cross-tier vectorization information preservation and refinement
