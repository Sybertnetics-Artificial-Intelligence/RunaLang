Note:
AOTT Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) Optimization Pass Module

This module implements common subexpression elimination for the AOTT compilation
system. It identifies and eliminates redundant computation of identical expressions
across basic blocks and functions, using value numbering and dominance analysis
to safely reuse computed values. The pass adapts its strategy based on optimization
tier, applying increasingly sophisticated analysis at higher tiers.

Core responsibilities:
- Local and global common subexpression identification
- Value numbering for expression equivalence detection
- Safe expression hoisting using dominance analysis
- Speculative CSE with deoptimization guard insertion
- Profile-guided CSE prioritization
- Cross-tier expression value preservation
