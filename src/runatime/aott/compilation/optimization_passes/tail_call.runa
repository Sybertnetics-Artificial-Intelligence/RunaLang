Note:
AOTT Tail Call Optimization Pass Module

This module implements tail call optimization for the AOTT compilation system.
It transforms tail calls into jumps to eliminate stack frame overhead and
enable efficient tail recursion. The pass analyzes call sites to identify
true tail calls, performs stack frame analysis to ensure safety, and applies
optimizations that range from simple tail call elimination to advanced
tail call threading across optimization tiers.

Core responsibilities:
- Tail call identification and validation
- Stack frame analysis for safe tail call transformation
- Tail recursive call optimization to iterative loops
- Speculative tail call optimization with guard insertion
- Profile-guided tail call prioritization
- Cross-function tail call chain optimization
