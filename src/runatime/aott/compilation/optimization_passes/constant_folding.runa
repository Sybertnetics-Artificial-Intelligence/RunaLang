Note:
AOTT Constant Folding Optimization Pass Module

This module implements constant folding optimization for the AOTT (Ahead-of-Time-Targeted)
compilation system. It evaluates constant expressions at compile time across all
optimization tiers, reducing runtime computation overhead and enabling further
optimizations. The pass operates on both bytecode and native code representations,
adapting its strategy based on the compilation tier and available analysis information.

Core responsibilities:
- Compile-time evaluation of constant arithmetic and logical expressions
- Constant propagation through SSA use-def chains
- Folding of constant array and struct operations
- Integration with speculation system for assumed-constant values
- Cross-tier constant information preservation
- Profile-guided constant value prediction
