AOTT Strength Reduction Optimization Pass Module

This module implements strength reduction optimization for the AOTT compilation
system. It replaces expensive operations with cheaper equivalent operations,
such as converting multiplications by constants to shifts and additions,
and divisions to multiplications by reciprocals. The pass analyzes arithmetic
operations, loop induction variables, and addressing computations to find
optimization opportunities.

Core responsibilities:
- Arithmetic operation strength reduction with constant analysis
- Loop induction variable strength reduction and optimization
- Address computation strength reduction for memory operations
- Speculative strength reduction with runtime validation
- Profile-guided optimization prioritization
- Target-specific strength reduction patterns
