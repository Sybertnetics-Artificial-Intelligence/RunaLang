//! AOTT Cache Eviction Policy Module
//!
//! This module implements various cache eviction policies for the AOTT compiled
//! code cache system. It provides pluggable eviction strategies that can be
//! selected based on compilation patterns, memory constraints, and performance
//! requirements. The eviction policies consider compilation cost, access patterns,
//! and compilation tier importance when making eviction decisions.
