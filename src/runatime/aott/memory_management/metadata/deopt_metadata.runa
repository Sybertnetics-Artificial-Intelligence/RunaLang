Note:
AOTT Deoptimization Metadata Module

This module implements deoptimization metadata management for the AOTT compilation
system. It stores and manages information necessary for safe deoptimization
from optimized code back to less optimized tiers, including state mapping,
guard information, and fallback execution paths. The module ensures correct
program execution during speculation failures and tier downgrades.

Core responsibilities:
- Deoptimization metadata storage and retrieval
- Execution state mapping between optimization tiers
- Speculation guard metadata management
- Fallback code path coordination
- Cross-tier deoptimization support
- Deoptimization performance tracking and optimization
