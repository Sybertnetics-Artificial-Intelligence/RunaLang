Note:
AOTT Type Metadata Caching Module

This module implements type metadata caching for the AOTT compilation system.
It manages cached type information, type layout data, and type-based optimization
metadata to accelerate compilation and enable sophisticated type-based optimizations.
The module provides efficient type lookup, inheritance analysis, and type
compatibility checking across all optimization tiers.

Core responsibilities:
- Type information caching with efficient lookup and storage
- Type layout and size information management
- Inheritance hierarchy caching and analysis
- Type-based optimization metadata tracking
- Cross-tier type metadata coordination
- Type compatibility and conversion analysis
