Note:
AOTT Profile Metadata Storage Module

This module implements comprehensive profile metadata storage for the AOTT
compilation system. It manages runtime execution profiles, performance metrics,
and behavioral data used to guide optimization decisions across all compilation
tiers. The module provides efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of
profile information with support for temporal analysis and trend detection.

Core responsibilities:
- Runtime profile data storage and management
- Execution frequency and hotness tracking
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Profile-guided optimization metadata storage
- Cross-tier profile information coordination
- Profile data validation and integrity management
