Note:
AOTT Method Compilation Metadata Management Module

This module implements comprehensive metadata management for compiled methods
in the AOTT system. It tracks compilation information, optimization decisions,
performance characteristics, and dependencies for each compiled method across
all optimization tiers. The metadata enables intelligent recompilation decisions,
tier transitions, and performance analysis.

Core responsibilities:
- Method compilation metadata storage and retrieval
- Optimization decision tracking and analysis
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Cross-tier compilation metadata coordination
- Metadata-driven recompilation and optimization decisions
- Integration with profiling and speculation systems
