Note:
AOTT Stack Map Generation and Management Module

This module implements stack map generation for the AOTT compilation system.
Stack maps provide precise information about the location of object references
in stack frames at GC safe points, enabling accurate and efficient garbage
collection. The module generates, validates, and manages stack maps across
all optimization tiers with support for speculative optimization.

Core responsibilities:
- Precise stack map generation for compiled functions
- GC root location tracking in stack frames
- Stack map optimization for minimal memory overhead
- Cross-tier stack map coordination and consistency
- Stack map validation and correctness verification
- Integration with deoptimization and speculation systems
