Note:
AOTT Garbage Collection Safe Point Management Module

This module implements GC safe point insertion and management for the AOTT
compilation system. It coordinates with the garbage collector to ensure that
compiled code can be safely interrupted for garbage collection while maintaining
program correctness. The module handles safe point insertion, stack scanning
preparation, and GC-safe code patching across all optimization tiers.

Core responsibilities:
- Safe point insertion analysis and placement optimization
- Stack frame analysis for GC root identification
- Safe point optimization with minimal performance overhead
- Cross-tier safe point coordination and consistency
- Profile-guided safe point placement optimization
- Integration with speculative optimization and deoptimization
