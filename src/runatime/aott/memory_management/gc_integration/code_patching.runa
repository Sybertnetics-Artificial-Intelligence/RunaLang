Note:
AOTT GC-Safe Code Patching Module

This module implements GC-safe code patching for the AOTT compilation system.
It enables safe modification of compiled code during runtime while ensuring
garbage collection safety and maintaining program correctness. The module
handles hot-swapping of optimized code, deoptimization patching, and profile-guided
code updates with proper synchronization and validation.

Core responsibilities:
- Safe code patching with GC coordination and synchronization
- Hot code swapping between optimization tiers
- Deoptimization patching for failed speculation
- Atomic code updates with rollback capabilities
- Patch validation and correctness verification
- Cross-tier code patching coordination
