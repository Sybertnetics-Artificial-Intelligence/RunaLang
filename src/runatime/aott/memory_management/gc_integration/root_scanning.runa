Note:
AOTT GC Root Scanning Integration Module

This module implements GC root scanning integration for the AOTT compilation
system. It provides efficient scanning of GC roots in compiled code, coordinating
with the garbage collector to identify all object references during collection
cycles. The module optimizes root scanning performance while ensuring complete
and accurate root identification across all optimization tiers.

Core responsibilities:
- Efficient GC root enumeration in compiled stack frames
- Root scanning optimization with minimal GC pause impact
- Stack walking integration for compiled code
- Object reference validation and type safety verification
- Cross-tier root scanning coordination and consistency
- Profile-guided root scanning optimization
