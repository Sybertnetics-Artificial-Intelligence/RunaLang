Note: Syscall Batch Processing System - High-performance batching for syscall optimization
Note: Collects multiple syscalls and executes them efficiently to reduce context switch overhead

@Reasoning
System calls have significant overhead due to user-kernel context switches. Many applications
make multiple related syscalls in sequence that could be batched together for better performance.
This module provides intelligent batching with dependency analysis, parallel execution where safe,
and optimized batch submission strategies based on platform capabilities.
@End Reasoning

@Implementation  
- Dependency-aware batch collection and execution ordering
- Parallel execution for independent syscalls with thread pool management
- Platform-specific batch optimization (io_uring on Linux, kqueue on BSD)
- Automatic batch size optimization based on syscall types and system load
- Result correlation and error handling for individual batched operations
- Memory-efficient batch storage with zero-copy result distribution
