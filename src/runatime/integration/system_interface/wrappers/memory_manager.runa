Note: Memory Manager Wrapper - Direct syscall interface for memory management
Note: Provides self-contained memory operations without stdlib dependencies

@Reasoning
The memory manager wrapper provides direct syscall access for memory management
operations. This is fundamental for the runtime to allocate, deallocate, and
manage memory regions without relying on any stdlib functionality. It provides
the foundation for implementing higher-level allocators and memory pools.
