Type Conversion and Marshaling Between Runa and Native Types

This module provides comprehensive type marshaling functionality including:
- Bidirectional type conversion between Runa and native representations
- Support for primitive types, structures, arrays, and pointers
- Complex type marshaling with nested structures and unions
- String encoding conversion (UTF-8, UTF-16, ASCII, platform-specific)
- Memory layout optimization for different architectures
- Type size calculation and alignment handling
- Endianness conversion for cross-platform compatibility
- Reference counting and ownership transfer management
- Custom marshaling for user-defined types
- Performance optimization through marshaling caches
- Type safety validation and runtime type checking
- Integration with AOTT system for optimized marshaling
- Support for variadic arguments and optional parameters
- Error handling for invalid type conversions
