C ABI Interface and Calling Convention Implementation

This module provides comprehensive C ABI interface functionality including:
- Standard C calling convention support (cdecl, stdcall, fastcall)
- Function signature analysis and validation for C compatibility
- C-style struct packing and alignment handling
- Variadic function support with proper argument handling
- C library integration with standard library functions
- Name mangling and symbol resolution for C functions
- Stack frame management for C function calls
- Register allocation and parameter passing conventions
- C-style error handling and errno management
- Memory management integration with C malloc/free
- Thread-local storage support for C libraries
- Platform-specific ABI variations (System V, Microsoft x64)
- Integration with standard C runtime libraries
- Support for C99, C11, and C18 language features
