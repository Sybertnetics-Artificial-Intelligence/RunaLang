Foreign Function Interface Bridge Implementation

This module provides comprehensive FFI bridge functionality including:
- Bidirectional function call marshaling between Runa and native code
- Type conversion and marshaling for complex data structures
- Memory management for FFI allocations and deallocations
- Error handling and exception translation across language boundaries
- Function pointer management and callback registration
- Thread-safe FFI operations with proper synchronization
- Dynamic symbol resolution and loading
- ABI compatibility layers for different calling conventions
- Performance optimized marshaling for hot paths
- Debug tracing and profiling of FFI calls
- Integration with AOTT system for optimized FFI performance
- Support for nested callbacks and re-entrant calls
- Automatic cleanup of FFI resources
- Cross-platform compatibility abstractions
