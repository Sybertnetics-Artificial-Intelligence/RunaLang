FFI Callback Registration and Management System

This module provides comprehensive callback management functionality including:
- Registration and lifecycle management of FFI callbacks
- Thread-safe callback invocation from native code
- Callback signature validation and type checking
- Performance optimized callback dispatch mechanisms
- Memory management for callback contexts and closures
- Error handling and exception propagation in callbacks
- Callback chaining and composition support
- Async callback handling with event loop integration
- Callback debugging and tracing capabilities
- Integration with AOTT system for optimized callback performance
- Support for variadic and optional callback parameters
- Callback reference counting and automatic cleanup
- Cross-thread callback marshaling and synchronization
- Hot-swapping and dynamic callback replacement
