Native Library Loading and Symbol Resolution

This module provides comprehensive native library loading functionality including:
- Dynamic library loading with platform-specific implementations
- Symbol resolution and address lookup with caching
- Library dependency resolution and loading order management
- Version compatibility checking and ABI validation
- Library unloading with proper cleanup and reference counting
- Security validation and sandboxing of loaded libraries
- Performance optimization for symbol lookup operations
- Thread-safe library loading and symbol resolution
- Error handling for missing libraries and symbols
- Integration with system library paths and search mechanisms
- Support for plugin architectures and modular loading
- Memory mapping optimization for large libraries
- Debug information preservation and symbol table access
- Cross-platform abstraction over dlopen/LoadLibrary APIs
