AOTT Code Cache Interface Service

This module provides the interface to the AOTT code cache system, managing
compiled code storage, retrieval, and lifecycle management. It handles:
- Compiled code storage and retrieval operations
- Code cache invalidation and eviction policies
- Cross-tier code sharing and deduplication
- Code cache performance monitoring and optimization
- Hot code reloading and live updates
- Code cache consistency and versioning
- Memory-mapped code execution and permissions
- Code cache persistence and recovery
- Distributed code cache synchronization
- Code cache security and integrity validation
