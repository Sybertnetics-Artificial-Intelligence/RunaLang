AOTT Deoptimization Handler Service

This module handles deoptimization events within the AOTT execution system,
managing the transition from optimized code back to safer execution modes. It handles:
- Deoptimization event detection and classification
- Execution state preservation and reconstruction
- Safe transition to fallback execution tiers
- Speculation failure recovery and adjustment
- Guard failure analysis and optimization adjustment
- Live deoptimization with minimal execution disruption
- Cascading deoptimization management across call chains
- Deoptimization metadata collection and analysis
- Performance impact assessment of deoptimization events
- Adaptive optimization strategy adjustment based on failures
