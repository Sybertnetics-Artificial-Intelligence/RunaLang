AOTT Tier Coordination Service

This module coordinates tier transitions within the AOTT execution system,
managing the movement between different optimization levels. It handles:
- Tier promotion and demotion decision making
- Cross-tier execution state management
- Optimization tier scheduling and resource allocation
- Tier transition cost-benefit analysis
- Concurrent tier compilation coordination
- Speculation budget management across tiers
- Deoptimization and fallback coordination
- Tier-specific optimization pipeline management
- Performance monitoring and tier effectiveness tracking
- Adaptive tier selection based on runtime feedback
