AOTT Execution Bridge Service

This module provides the core bridge interface between the runtime and the AOTT
(All-Of-The-Time) execution system. It handles:
- Execution requests to different AOTT tiers
- Tier promotion and demotion coordination
- Function compilation requests and caching
- Runtime to AOTT communication protocol
- Execution mode switching and fallback handling
- Performance monitoring and tier selection
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Hot code replacement and live patching
- Speculation budget management
- Bytecode to native code transitions
