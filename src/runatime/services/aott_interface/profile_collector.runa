AOTT Profile Collection Service

This module provides comprehensive profile collection for the AOTT system,
gathering execution data needed for optimization decisions. It handles:
- Runtime execution profiling and hotspot detection
- Type profiling and polymorphic call site analysis
- Branch profiling and control flow pattern analysis
- Memory allocation profiling and escape analysis data
- Performance counter collection and statistical analysis
- Profile data aggregation and compression
- Historical trend analysis and prediction
- Profile-guided optimization data preparation
- Cross-function call profiling and inlining hints
- Dynamic type feedback and specialization opportunities
