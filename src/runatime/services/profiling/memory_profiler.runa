- Allocation and deallocation tracking with stack traces
- Memory usage statistics and trend analysis
- Memory leak detection and root cause analysis
- Garbage collection performance monitoring
- Heap fragmentation analysis and optimization
- Object lifetime tracking and analysis
- Memory access pattern profiling
- Cache efficiency measurement and optimization
