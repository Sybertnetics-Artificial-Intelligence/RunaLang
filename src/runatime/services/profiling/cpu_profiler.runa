Runtime CPU Profiling Service

This module provides comprehensive CPU profiling capabilities for the runtime,
collecting detailed execution data for performance analysis and optimization. It handles:
- Statistical sampling profiling with configurable intervals
- Instrumentation-based profiling for detailed function analysis  
- Call graph construction and analysis
- Hot path identification and optimization guidance
- CPU usage breakdown by function and module
- Performance counter integration and hardware monitoring
- Multi-threaded profiling with thread-aware analysis
- Real-time profiling data visualization and reporting
- Profile data export and integration with external tools
- Adaptive profiling with minimal runtime overhead
