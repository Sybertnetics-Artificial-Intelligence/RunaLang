Runtime Allocation Tracking Service

This module provides detailed tracking of memory allocations and deallocations
for performance analysis, leak detection, and optimization guidance. It handles:
- High-resolution allocation and deallocation event tracking
- Stack trace capture and analysis for allocation context
- Object type classification and lifecycle monitoring
- Allocation site hotspot identification and analysis
- Memory pool usage tracking and optimization
- Allocation pattern recognition and prediction
- Cross-thread allocation tracking and synchronization
- Real-time allocation monitoring with minimal overhead
- Integration with garbage collector for comprehensive lifecycle tracking
- Custom allocator integration and monitoring support
