Permission Management and Access Control System Module

This module provides comprehensive permission management and access control
capabilities for the Runa runtime environment. It implements role-based access
control (RBAC), capability-based security, fine-grained permissions, and
multi-level authorization mechanisms to ensure secure resource access.

Core responsibilities:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Capability-based security model
- Fine-grained permission management
- User identity and authentication integration
- Resource access authorization
- Permission inheritance and delegation mechanisms
