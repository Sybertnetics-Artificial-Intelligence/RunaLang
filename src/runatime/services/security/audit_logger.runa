Security Auditing and Compliance Logging Module

This module provides comprehensive security auditing and compliance logging
capabilities for the Runa runtime environment. It captures security events,
maintains tamper-proof audit trails, generates compliance reports, and provides
forensic analysis capabilities for security investigations.

Core responsibilities:
- Security event capture and logging
- Tamper-proof audit trail maintenance
- Access attempt and authorization logging
- Compliance reporting and evidence collection
- Forensic analysis and investigation support
- Security incident correlation and alerting
