Code Sandboxing and Execution Isolation Module

This module provides comprehensive code sandboxing and execution isolation
capabilities for the Runa runtime environment. It creates secure execution
contexts, enforces resource limitations, prevents unauthorized access, and
maintains strong isolation boundaries between different execution contexts.

Core responsibilities:
- Secure execution context creation and management
- Resource limitation and quota enforcement
- File system access control and virtual file systems
- Network access restriction and monitoring
- System call filtering and interception
- Memory isolation and protection mechanisms
