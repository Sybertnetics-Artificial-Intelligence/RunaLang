Centralized Logging System and Log Management Module

This module provides a comprehensive centralized logging system for the Runa
runtime environment. It handles log collection, filtering, formatting, storage,
rotation, and analysis. Supports structured logging, multiple log levels,
distributed log aggregation, and real-time log monitoring.

Core responsibilities:
- Centralized log collection and aggregation
- Log level management and filtering
- Structured logging with contextual metadata
- Log rotation, archival, and retention policies
- Real-time log streaming and monitoring
- Log analysis, search, and alerting capabilities
