System Resource Usage Monitoring and Tracking Module

This module provides comprehensive monitoring of system resources including CPU,
memory, disk, network, and other hardware resources. It tracks usage patterns,
identifies resource bottlenecks, manages thresholds, and provides resource
allocation insights for the Runa runtime environment.

Core responsibilities:
- CPU usage monitoring across cores and processes
- Memory allocation and usage tracking (heap, stack, virtual)
- Disk I/O monitoring and storage capacity tracking
- Network bandwidth and connection monitoring
- Resource threshold management and alert generation
- Resource usage trend analysis and forecasting
