System Health Monitoring and Status Reporting Module

This module provides comprehensive system health monitoring capabilities for the
Runa runtime environment. It tracks component status, service availability,
system resources, and generates alerts for anomalies. Essential for maintaining
runtime stability and early detection of issues.

Core responsibilities:
- Component health status tracking and reporting
- Service availability monitoring and uptime tracking
- System resource health assessment and thresholds
- Alert generation and notification for health issues
- Health dashboard data aggregation
- Dependency chain health validation
