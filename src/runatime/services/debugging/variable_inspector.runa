Runtime Variable Inspector Service

This module provides comprehensive variable inspection capabilities for debugging,
allowing examination and modification of program state during execution. It handles:
- Local and global variable enumeration and inspection
- Complex data structure traversal and visualization
- Variable value modification during debugging sessions
- Type information retrieval and analysis
- Memory layout inspection for variables and objects
- Watch expression evaluation and monitoring
- Variable scope analysis and resolution
- Cross-thread variable access and synchronization
- Optimized variable reconstruction from debug information
- Integration with debugger UI for variable display
