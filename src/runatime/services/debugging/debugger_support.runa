This module provides comprehensive debugging support infrastructure for the runtime,
enabling integration with external debuggers and providing debugging capabilities. It handles:
- Debug information generation and management
- Debugging protocol implementation and communication
- Debug session lifecycle management
- Source-level debugging with optimized code mapping
- Remote debugging support and security
- Debug symbol management and resolution
- Exception and error handling during debugging
- Multi-threaded debugging coordination
