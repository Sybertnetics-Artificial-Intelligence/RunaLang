Runtime Breakpoint Management Service

This module provides comprehensive breakpoint management for the runtime debugging
system, handling all aspects of breakpoint lifecycle and operation. It handles:
- Source-level and instruction-level breakpoint management
- Conditional and unconditional breakpoint support
- Hardware and software breakpoint implementation
- Breakpoint synchronization across optimization tiers
- Dynamic breakpoint insertion and removal in running code
- Breakpoint hit counting and frequency analysis
- Watchpoint and data breakpoint management
- Breakpoint persistence and session management
- Performance-optimized breakpoint implementation
- Cross-thread breakpoint coordination and management
