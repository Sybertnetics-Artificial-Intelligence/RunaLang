File System Monitoring and Watching

This module provides comprehensive file system monitoring including:
- Real-time file and directory change detection
- Event-based notifications (create, modify, delete, rename)
- Recursive directory watching
- File content change detection
- Attribute and permission change monitoring
- Cross-platform file watching (inotify, FSEvents, ReadDirectoryChangesW)
- Batch event processing and debouncing
- Watch filter configuration
- Performance-optimized monitoring
- Network file system support
- Symbolic link monitoring
- Watch persistence and recovery
- Event history and replay
- Custom event handlers
