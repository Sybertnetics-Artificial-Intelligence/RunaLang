- Path component extraction (basename, dirname, extension)
- Path validation and sanitization
- Cross-platform path handling
- UNC and network path support
- Path pattern matching and globbing
- Path comparison and equality
- Virtual path mapping
- Path security validation
- URL to path conversion
- Path encoding and decoding
