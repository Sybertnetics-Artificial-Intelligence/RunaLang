File System Operations

This module provides comprehensive file operations including:
- File reading (text, binary, streaming, memory-mapped)
- File writing (create, append, truncate, atomic writes)
- File metadata operations (size, timestamps, permissions)
- File locking and synchronization
- File copying, moving, and renaming
- Buffered and unbuffered I/O operations
- Asynchronous file operations
- File compression and decompression support
- File encryption and decryption operations
- File integrity verification (checksums, hashes)
- Cross-platform file handling
- Large file support (>4GB)
- Sparse file operations
- File transaction support with rollback
