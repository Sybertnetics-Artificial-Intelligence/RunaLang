- Binary and text message handling
- Ping/pong heartbeat
- Connection state management
- Frame parsing and creation
- Compression support (permessage-deflate)
- Subprotocol negotiation
- Connection pooling
- Auto-reconnection
- Message fragmentation
- Close handshake
- Extension support
- Secure WebSocket (WSS)
