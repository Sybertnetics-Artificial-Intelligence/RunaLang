Asynchronous Socket Operations and Event-Driven Networking

This module provides comprehensive asynchronous socket programming capabilities
for high-performance, scalable network applications. Implements event-driven
networking with support for thousands of concurrent connections, non-blocking I/O,
and efficient resource utilization through modern async/await patterns.

Key Features:
- Asynchronous socket creation and management
- Non-blocking connect, send, and receive operations
- Event-driven I/O with select, poll, epoll, and kqueue support
- Async/await pattern implementation for network operations
- Concurrent connection handling and multiplexing
- Asynchronous DNS resolution and hostname lookup
- Promise-based networking APIs
- Event loop integration and management
- Asynchronous SSL/TLS handshake and communication
- Backpressure handling and flow control
- Connection pooling with async resource management
- Timeout and cancellation support for async operations
- Error propagation and exception handling in async context
- Metrics and monitoring for async socket operations
- Memory-efficient async buffer management
- Cross-platform async networking compatibility
- Integration with threading and coroutine systems
- Async socket option configuration
- Event notification and callback systems
- High-performance async server implementations

Physical Foundation:
Asynchronous networking utilizes non-blocking system calls and event notification
mechanisms to handle multiple network operations concurrently within a single
thread or small thread pool. This approach maximizes CPU utilization and enables
handling of thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

Applications:
Web servers, real-time chat systems, gaming servers, IoT gateways, streaming
services, microservice architectures, API gateways, proxy servers, and any
application requiring high-concurrency network communication.
