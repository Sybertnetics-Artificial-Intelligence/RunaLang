UDP Socket Operations and Datagram Management

This module provides comprehensive UDP socket programming capabilities including
datagram transmission, connectionless communication, and broadcast/multicast
support. Implements both blocking and non-blocking UDP operations with full
error handling and packet management for unreliable datagram services.

Key Features:
- UDP client and server socket creation
- Datagram sending and receiving operations
- Connectionless communication patterns
- Broadcast and multicast datagram support
- Socket option configuration for UDP sockets
- Non-blocking and asynchronous UDP operations
- Packet size validation and fragmentation handling
- UDP socket multiplexing and event handling
- Network interface binding and routing
- Socket buffer management and optimization
- UDP packet statistics and monitoring
- Datagram encryption and security
- Socket timeout and deadline management
- Connection-less peer discovery
- UDP socket debugging and diagnostics
- Packet loss detection and handling
- Socket address reuse and port sharing
- Network quality measurement
- UDP socket performance optimization
- Datagram filtering and routing rules

Physical Foundation:
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) provides connectionless, unreliable datagram
delivery service. Unlike TCP, UDP does not guarantee delivery, ordering, or
duplicate protection, making it suitable for applications where speed and
low overhead are more important than reliability.

Applications:
DNS queries, DHCP, streaming media, online gaming, IoT sensor data,
broadcast messaging, network discovery protocols, real-time communications,
logging systems, and high-performance distributed systems.
