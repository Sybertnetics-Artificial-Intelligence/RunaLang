Socket Options Configuration and Management

This module provides comprehensive socket option configuration and management
capabilities for fine-tuning socket behavior, performance optimization, and
protocol-specific settings. Supports platform-independent socket option
handling with validation and error management.

Key Features:
- Comprehensive socket option configuration
- Platform-independent option handling
- Socket performance tuning and optimization
- Protocol-specific option management
- Buffer size configuration and optimization
- Timeout and deadline management
- Socket security and access control options
- Quality of Service (QoS) configuration
- Socket debugging and diagnostics options
- Connection behavior customization
- Socket error handling configuration
- Network interface binding options
- Socket reuse and sharing configuration
- Priority and scheduling options
- Socket monitoring and statistics options
- Cross-platform compatibility handling
- Option validation and error checking
- Dynamic option modification support
- Socket option inheritance and defaults
- Advanced networking feature configuration

Physical Foundation:
Socket options provide fine-grained control over socket behavior at the
operating system level. They configure various aspects of network communication
including buffer management, timeout handling, protocol-specific features,
and performance optimization parameters.

Applications:
High-performance network servers, real-time applications, custom protocol
implementations, network monitoring tools, multimedia streaming, gaming
applications, and specialized networking software requiring precise control.
