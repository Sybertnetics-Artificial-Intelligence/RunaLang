Multicast Socket Operations and Group Management

This module provides comprehensive multicast socket programming capabilities
for one-to-many communication patterns. Implements multicast group management,
efficient data distribution, and scalable network communication with support
for both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast protocols.

Key Features:
- Multicast group creation and management
- IPv4 and IPv6 multicast support
- Multicast sender and receiver operations
- Time-to-Live (TTL) and hop limit control
- Multicast interface selection and binding
- Source-specific multicast (SSM) support
- Any-source multicast (ASM) operations
- Multicast routing and forwarding control
- Group membership management and monitoring
- Multicast security and access control
- Bandwidth management and traffic shaping
- Multicast reliability and error recovery
- Load balancing across multicast streams
- Multicast session management
- Quality of Service (QoS) for multicast
- Multicast statistics and performance monitoring
- Cross-platform multicast compatibility
- Multicast testing and diagnostics
- Protocol-independent multicast support
- Multicast address allocation and management

Physical Foundation:
IP Multicast enables efficient one-to-many communication by delivering packets
to multiple receivers simultaneously. Uses Class D addresses (224.0.0.0/4) for
IPv4 and FF00::/8 for IPv6, with routers handling packet replication and
distribution across network segments.

Applications:
Video streaming, audio broadcasting, software updates, financial data feeds,
gaming servers, collaborative applications, network discovery, real-time data
distribution, and content delivery networks.
