Raw Socket Operations and Packet Crafting

This module provides comprehensive raw socket programming capabilities for
low-level network programming, packet crafting, and protocol implementation.
Enables direct access to network protocols below the transport layer with
custom packet construction, network monitoring, and protocol analysis.

Key Features:
- Raw socket creation for custom protocol implementation
- Direct IP packet crafting and manipulation
- Custom protocol header construction and parsing
- Network packet interception and analysis
- Protocol testing and network diagnostics
- Low-level network programming capabilities
- Packet filtering and selective capture
- Network interface direct access
- Custom routing and packet forwarding
- Protocol reverse engineering support
- Network security testing capabilities
- Packet injection and spoofing prevention
- Network performance monitoring
- Protocol compliance testing
- Packet timestamp and latency measurement
- Custom network stack implementation
- Protocol fuzzing and testing frameworks
- Network traffic analysis and inspection
- Packet modification and rewriting
- Advanced network troubleshooting tools

Physical Foundation:
Raw sockets provide direct access to network protocols at the IP layer and below,
bypassing the operating system's protocol stack. This enables custom protocol
implementation, network analysis, and low-level network programming with full
control over packet construction and transmission.

Applications:
Network monitoring tools, protocol analyzers, custom protocol implementations,
network security scanners, packet capture utilities, network testing tools,
custom VPN implementations, and specialized networking applications.
