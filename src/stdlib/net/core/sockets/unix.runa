Unix Domain Socket Operations and Local IPC

This module provides comprehensive Unix domain socket programming capabilities
for local inter-process communication (IPC). Implements both stream (SOCK_STREAM)
and datagram (SOCK_DGRAM) Unix sockets with file system path binding,
credential passing, and high-performance local communication.

Key Features:
- Unix stream socket creation and connection management
- Unix datagram socket operations and message passing
- File system path binding and abstract namespace support
- Socket credential passing and authentication
- File descriptor passing between processes
- Non-blocking and asynchronous Unix socket operations
- Socket permission management and access control
- Unix socket multiplexing and event handling
- Socket buffer management and optimization
- Connection state monitoring and diagnostics
- Socket cleanup and resource management
- Unix socket security and sandboxing
- Process identification and credential verification
- Socket timeout and deadline management
- Unix socket debugging and introspection
- Socket path resolution and validation
- Connection pooling for Unix sockets
- Socket statistics and performance monitoring
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Socket option configuration and tuning

Physical Foundation:
Unix domain sockets provide high-performance IPC mechanisms within a single
host system. They use file system pathnames or abstract namespace for
addressing and support both reliable stream and unreliable datagram semantics
without network protocol overhead.

Applications:
Database server connections, web server FastCGI, Docker daemon communication,
X11 server connections, systemd service communication, container orchestration,
local message queues, and high-performance microservice communication.
