TCP Socket Operations and Connection Management

This module provides comprehensive TCP socket programming capabilities including
client and server socket creation, connection management, data transmission,
and advanced TCP socket configuration. Implements both blocking and non-blocking
TCP operations with full error handling and connection state management.

Key Features:
- TCP client socket creation and connection establishment
- TCP server socket binding, listening, and accept operations
- Reliable data transmission with send/receive operations
- Connection state management and monitoring
- Socket option configuration (keep-alive, no-delay, buffer sizes)
- Non-blocking and asynchronous TCP operations
- Connection pooling and multiplexing support
- SSL/TLS integration for secure TCP connections
- TCP socket timeouts and deadline management
- Connection graceful shutdown and error recovery
- TCP socket statistics and performance monitoring
- Multi-threaded connection handling
- Socket descriptor management and cleanup
- TCP socket security and access control
- Connection bandwidth throttling and QoS
- TCP socket debugging and diagnostics
- Connection load balancing and failover
- Socket buffer management and optimization
- TCP connection state inspection
- Network interface binding and routing

Physical Foundation:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked
delivery of data streams between applications. Built on top of IP, TCP uses
sequence numbers, acknowledgments, and sliding window flow control to ensure
reliable data transmission with congestion control and connection management.

Applications:
Web servers and clients, database connections, file transfer protocols,
email systems, chat applications, streaming services, API endpoints,
microservices communication, and any application requiring reliable data delivery.
