Network Monitoring and Health Assessment

This module provides comprehensive network monitoring and health assessment functionality including:
- Real-time network performance monitoring and alerting
- Multi-dimensional network health metrics collection
- Proactive anomaly detection and trend analysis
- Service level agreement (SLA) monitoring and compliance
- Network topology discovery and change detection
- Application performance monitoring (APM) integration
- Infrastructure monitoring with SNMP and telemetry
- Event correlation and root cause analysis
- Predictive analytics for network maintenance
- Custom monitoring dashboards and visualization
- Integration with external monitoring platforms
- Automated remediation and self-healing capabilities

Network Foundation:
Network monitoring is essential for maintaining optimal network performance,
ensuring service availability, and proactive problem resolution. This
module provides sophisticated monitoring capabilities with intelligent
analytics and automated response mechanisms for modern network infrastructure.

Monitoring Scope:
Supports monitoring of physical infrastructure, virtual networks, cloud
environments, and hybrid architectures with unified visibility and
comprehensive health assessment across all network layers.
