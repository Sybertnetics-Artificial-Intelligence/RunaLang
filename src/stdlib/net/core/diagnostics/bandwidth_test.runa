Network Bandwidth Testing and Performance Measurement

This module provides comprehensive network bandwidth testing functionality including:
- TCP and UDP bandwidth throughput testing similar to iperf
- Bidirectional and unidirectional bandwidth measurement
- Multi-threaded and parallel connection testing
- Quality of Service (QoS) bandwidth testing with traffic classes
- Bandwidth testing with various packet sizes and patterns
- Real-time bandwidth monitoring during test execution
- Network congestion impact analysis on bandwidth performance
- Application-layer bandwidth testing for specific protocols
- Geographic and distributed bandwidth testing coordination
- Automated bandwidth testing with scheduling and reporting
- Integration with network monitoring and performance management
- Comparative bandwidth analysis across different network paths

Network Foundation:
Bandwidth testing is essential for network capacity planning, performance
validation, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and ensuring service
level agreements. This module provides sophisticated bandwidth measurement
capabilities with comprehensive analysis and reporting features.

Testing Methods:
Supports various testing methodologies including TCP window scaling,
UDP burst testing, adaptive bitrate testing, and custom protocol
testing with configurable parameters for different network scenarios
and performance requirements.
