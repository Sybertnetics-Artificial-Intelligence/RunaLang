Network Traceroute and Path Discovery

This module provides comprehensive network traceroute functionality and path discovery including:
- ICMP and UDP traceroute implementation with IPv4 and IPv6 support
- TCP traceroute for firewall traversal and port-specific path tracing
- Multi-path traceroute for load-balanced network discovery
- Path MTU discovery integrated with traceroute functionality
- Geographic and AS-aware traceroute with enriched path information
- Continuous traceroute monitoring for path stability analysis
- Parallel traceroute operations for comparative path analysis
- Integration with network topology mapping and visualization
- Traceroute-based network troubleshooting and diagnostics
- Custom probe packet traceroute for application-specific testing
- Performance analysis along network paths with hop-by-hop metrics
- Advanced traceroute features for modern network architectures

Network Foundation:
Traceroute is essential for network path discovery, troubleshooting routing
issues, and understanding network topology. This module provides sophisticated
traceroute capabilities with advanced analysis features for comprehensive
network path visibility and performance assessment.

Protocol Support:
Supports ICMP Time Exceeded, UDP port unreachable, TCP SYN/ACK traceroute
methods with configurable probe types, timing parameters, and comprehensive
error handling for different network environments.
