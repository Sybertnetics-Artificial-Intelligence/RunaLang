Network Packet Capture and Analysis

This module provides comprehensive network packet capture and analysis functionality including:
- Live packet capture from network interfaces with filtering capabilities
- Packet capture file reading and writing (PCAP, PCAPNG formats)
- Protocol analysis and packet dissection for multiple network layers
- Traffic pattern analysis and flow reconstruction
- Security analysis and intrusion detection from captured packets
- Performance analysis and network troubleshooting from packet data
- Real-time packet filtering and processing
- Statistical analysis of captured network traffic
- Integration with network monitoring and security systems
- Custom protocol analysis and signature-based detection
- Distributed packet capture coordination across multiple points
- Packet replay and network simulation capabilities

Network Foundation:
Packet capture is fundamental for network troubleshooting, security analysis,
performance monitoring, and protocol development. This module provides
comprehensive packet capture capabilities with advanced analysis features
for deep network visibility and understanding.

Capture Technologies:
Supports libpcap, WinPcap, Npcap, DPDK, and other packet capture frameworks
with high-performance capture capabilities, flexible filtering, and
comprehensive analysis tools for modern network environments.
