Network Statistics and Connection Analysis

This module provides comprehensive network statistics and connection analysis functionality including:
- Active network connections enumeration and monitoring
- Socket state analysis and connection lifecycle tracking
- Network interface statistics and performance metrics
- Protocol-specific statistics (TCP, UDP, ICMP, IPv4, IPv6)
- Process-to-network mapping and port utilization analysis
- Connection performance analysis and troubleshooting
- Network usage patterns and traffic flow analysis
- Real-time connection monitoring and alerting
- Historical connection data analysis and trending
- Security-focused connection analysis and anomaly detection
- Cross-platform network statistics collection
- Integration with system monitoring and management tools

Network Foundation:
Network statistics and connection analysis are essential for understanding
network utilization, diagnosing connectivity issues, monitoring security,
and optimizing network performance. This module provides comprehensive
visibility into network stack behavior and connection patterns.

Platform Support:
Supports Windows netstat, Linux /proc/net, BSD socket statistics, and
modern alternatives like ss command with unified APIs for cross-platform
network statistics collection and analysis.
