Network Ping Utilities and Connectivity Testing

This module provides comprehensive network ping functionality and connectivity testing including:
- ICMP ping implementation with IPv4 and IPv6 support
- Advanced ping options (packet size, interval, count, timeout)
- Continuous and scheduled ping monitoring
- Statistical analysis of ping results (RTT, loss, jitter)
- Multi-target ping operations and comparison
- Path MTU discovery using ping
- Flood ping and stress testing capabilities
- Ping sweep for network discovery
- Geographic and distributed ping measurements
- Integration with network monitoring systems
- Custom payload ping for application testing
- Ping-based network troubleshooting tools

Network Foundation:
Ping is a fundamental network diagnostic tool for testing reachability,
measuring round-trip time, and detecting network connectivity issues.
This module provides comprehensive ping functionality with advanced
features for network monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance analysis.

Protocol Support:
Supports ICMP Echo Request/Reply for IPv4, ICMPv6 Echo Request/Reply for IPv6,
and various ping implementations across different platforms with unified APIs
and comprehensive error handling.
