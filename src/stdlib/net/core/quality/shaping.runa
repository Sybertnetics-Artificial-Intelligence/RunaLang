Network Traffic Shaping and Rate Control

This module provides comprehensive network traffic shaping and rate control functionality including:
- Traffic shaping algorithms (Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, HTB, CBQ)
- Rate limiting and bandwidth throttling mechanisms
- Burst control and traffic smoothing
- Hierarchical traffic shaping with nested classes
- Per-flow and aggregate traffic shaping
- Dynamic shaping based on network conditions
- Application-aware traffic shaping policies
- Integration with Quality of Service frameworks
- Traffic policing and compliance enforcement
- Congestion-responsive shaping algorithms
- Multi-level shaping hierarchies and inheritance
- Performance optimization and monitoring

Network Foundation:
Traffic shaping is essential for controlling network resource utilization,
ensuring fair bandwidth distribution, and maintaining quality of service.
This module implements sophisticated algorithms for managing traffic flow
rates while preserving application performance requirements.

Shaping Algorithms:
Supports industry-standard algorithms including Token Bucket Filter (TBF),
Hierarchical Token Bucket (HTB), Class-Based Queuing (CBQ), and custom
algorithms with configurable parameters for different traffic scenarios.
