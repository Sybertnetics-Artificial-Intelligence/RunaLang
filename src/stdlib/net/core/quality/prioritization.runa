Network Traffic Prioritization and QoS Classification

This module provides comprehensive network traffic prioritization and Quality of Service classification including:
- Traffic classification and marking (DSCP, ToS, 802.1p)
- Priority queue management and scheduling algorithms
- Service class definition and enforcement
- Application-aware traffic prioritization
- Dynamic priority adjustment based on network conditions
- Multi-level priority hierarchies and inheritance
- Priority-based admission control and resource allocation
- Real-time traffic prioritization for latency-sensitive applications
- Priority conflict resolution and policy enforcement
- Network-wide priority coordination and consistency
- Integration with routing protocols for priority-aware forwarding
- Advanced scheduling algorithms for priority enforcement

Network Foundation:
Traffic prioritization is essential for ensuring critical applications receive
appropriate network resources while maintaining overall network efficiency.
This module implements sophisticated priority mechanisms that enable fine-grained
control over traffic treatment throughout the network infrastructure.

Priority Models:
Supports strict priority, weighted priority, deficit-based priority, and
hybrid priority models with configurable policies and real-time adaptation
to changing network conditions and application requirements.
