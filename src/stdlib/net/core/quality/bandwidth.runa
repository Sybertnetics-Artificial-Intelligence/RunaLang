Network Bandwidth Management and Throttling

This module provides comprehensive network bandwidth management functionality including:
- Bandwidth allocation and quota management per interface or flow
- Traffic shaping and rate limiting algorithms
- Burst allowance and token bucket implementations
- Hierarchical bandwidth allocation with priority classes
- Dynamic bandwidth adjustment based on network conditions
- Bandwidth monitoring and utilization tracking
- Fair queuing and weighted fair queuing algorithms
- Committed Information Rate (CIR) and Excess Information Rate (EIR) management
- Bandwidth over-subscription and burst management
- Application-aware bandwidth allocation
- Network congestion control and bandwidth throttling
- Quality of Service integration for bandwidth guarantees

Network Foundation:
Bandwidth management is crucial for ensuring fair resource allocation,
preventing congestion, and meeting service level agreements. This module
implements advanced traffic shaping algorithms and provides comprehensive
bandwidth control capabilities for modern network environments.

Algorithm Support:
Supports Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Hierarchical Token Bucket (HTB),
Class-Based Queuing (CBQ), and Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) algorithms
with configurable parameters and real-time adjustment capabilities.
