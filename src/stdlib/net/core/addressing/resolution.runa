Address Resolution and Name Service Operations

This module provides comprehensive address resolution capabilities including
hostname to IP resolution, reverse DNS lookup, service discovery, and
advanced name resolution features for network programming and system
administration.

Key Features:
- Hostname to IP address resolution (forward DNS)
- IP address to hostname resolution (reverse DNS)
- Service discovery and service record resolution
- Multiple resolution protocol support (DNS, mDNS, LLMNR)
- Resolution caching and cache management
- Asynchronous and parallel resolution operations
- Custom resolver configuration and management
- Resolution failover and redundancy
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Cross-platform name resolution compatibility
- Resolution debugging and diagnostic tools
- Integration with system resolver libraries
- Custom resolution policies and rules
- Network topology-aware resolution
- Security-enhanced resolution with validation
- Load balancing for resolution services
- Resolution statistics and analytics
- Advanced resolution features and extensions
- Multi-protocol resolution coordination
- Enterprise directory integration

Physical Foundation:
Address resolution translates human-readable names to network addresses
and vice versa. It relies on distributed naming systems like DNS,
local protocols like mDNS, and various directory services to provide
scalable and reliable name-to-address mapping services.

Applications:
Web browsers, email clients, network applications, system administration
tools, monitoring systems, service discovery frameworks, and any
application requiring name-to-address translation services.
