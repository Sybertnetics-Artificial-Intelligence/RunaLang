Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) Operations and Management

This module provides comprehensive CIDR notation handling and subnet
calculations for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Includes CIDR parsing,
validation, conversion, and advanced network operations using modern
classless addressing concepts.

Key Features:
- CIDR notation parsing and validation for IPv4 and IPv6
- Network address and subnet mask calculations from CIDR
- CIDR block manipulation and operations
- Subnet aggregation and summarization using CIDR
- CIDR block intersection and overlap detection
- Network containment and hierarchy analysis
- CIDR-based access control and filtering
- Route aggregation and optimization using CIDR
- CIDR block splitting and merging operations
- Network efficiency analysis with CIDR metrics
- Cross-platform CIDR compatibility
- Performance-optimized CIDR operations
- CIDR debugging and diagnostic tools
- Custom CIDR validation rules
- Network documentation using CIDR notation
- CIDR-based network planning and design
- Integration with routing protocols
- Advanced CIDR networking utilities
- CIDR format conversion and standardization
- Network topology analysis using CIDR

Physical Foundation:
CIDR eliminates the traditional class-based addressing by using variable-length
subnet masking (VLSM). It uses prefix notation (e.g., /24) to specify the
network portion length, enabling more efficient address allocation and
routing table size reduction through route aggregation.

Applications:
Routing software, network configuration tools, firewall rule management,
network monitoring systems, IP address management (IPAM), and any application
requiring efficient network address representation and manipulation.
