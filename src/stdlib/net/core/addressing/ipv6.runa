IPv6 Address Manipulation and Network Operations

This module provides comprehensive IPv6 address manipulation capabilities
including address validation, prefix calculations, address compression,
and network analysis. Supports all IPv6 addressing concepts and advanced
features for modern network programming.

Key Features:
- IPv6 address validation and format conversion
- Address compression and expansion operations
- IPv6 prefix calculations and subnet operations
- Link-local and unique local address handling
- IPv6 address scope and type determination
- EUI-64 interface identifier generation
- IPv6 address privacy extensions support
- Multicast and anycast address operations
- IPv6 network summarization and aggregation
- Address range generation and validation
- IPv6 address pool management
- Dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 operations
- IPv6 address arithmetic and manipulation
- Cross-platform IPv6 address handling
- Performance-optimized IPv6 operations
- IPv6 addressing diagnostics and analysis
- Custom address validation rules
- Address format standardization
- Network topology calculations for IPv6
- Advanced IPv6 networking utilities

Physical Foundation:
IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses providing an enormous address space of
approximately 3.4Ã—10^38 addresses. Addresses use hexadecimal notation
with compression features and hierarchical structure enabling efficient
routing and auto-configuration in modern networks.

Applications:
Modern network stacks, IPv6 routers, network configuration tools,
dual-stack applications, mobile networks, IoT deployments, and any
system requiring IPv6 address manipulation and network calculations.
