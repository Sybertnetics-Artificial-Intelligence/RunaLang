IPv4 Address Manipulation and Subnet Calculations

This module provides comprehensive IPv4 address manipulation capabilities
including address validation, subnet calculations, address range operations,
and network analysis. Supports all IPv4 addressing concepts and operations
for network programming and administration.

Key Features:
- IPv4 address validation and format conversion
- Subnet mask calculations and CIDR notation support
- Network address and broadcast address calculation
- IP address range generation and validation
- Subnetting and supernetting operations
- Address class determination (A, B, C, D, E)
- Private and public address classification
- Address collision detection and validation
- Network overlap and containment analysis
- IPv4 address arithmetic and manipulation
- Address pool management and allocation
- Network summarization and aggregation
- IPv4 address space optimization
- Cross-platform address handling
- Performance-optimized address operations
- IPv4 addressing diagnostics and analysis
- Custom address validation rules
- Address format standardization
- Network topology calculations
- Advanced IPv4 networking utilities

Physical Foundation:
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses providing approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
Addresses are organized hierarchically with network and host portions
determined by subnet masks, enabling efficient routing and address allocation
in hierarchical network structures.

Applications:
Network configuration tools, DHCP servers, routing software, network
monitoring systems, security appliances, and any application requiring
IPv4 address manipulation and network calculations.
