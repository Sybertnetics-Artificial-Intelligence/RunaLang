Network Port Management and Allocation Operations

This module provides comprehensive network port management capabilities
including port allocation, range management, service identification,
and advanced port operations for network programming and system
administration.

Key Features:
- Network port validation and range checking
- Dynamic port allocation and management
- Well-known port identification and service mapping
- Port range management and reservation
- Port pool allocation and tracking
- Port collision detection and resolution
- Cross-platform port handling
- Performance-optimized port operations
- Port usage monitoring and statistics
- Port security and access control
- Service discovery using port information
- Port forwarding and translation support
- Advanced port networking utilities
- Port configuration management
- Integration with firewall and security systems
- Port scanning and discovery tools
- Load balancing port management
- High availability port allocation
- Custom port allocation policies
- Network service port coordination

Physical Foundation:
Network ports are 16-bit numbers used by transport layer protocols
(TCP/UDP) to identify specific services or processes on a host.
Ports enable multiplexing of network connections, allowing multiple
services to operate simultaneously on a single IP address.

Applications:
Network servers, client applications, firewall systems, load balancers,
proxy servers, network monitoring tools, service discovery systems,
and any application requiring network port management and allocation.
