Media Access Control (MAC) Address Operations and Management

This module provides comprehensive MAC address manipulation and management
capabilities including address validation, format conversion, manufacturer
identification, and advanced MAC address operations for network programming
and system administration.

Key Features:
- MAC address validation and format conversion
- Multiple MAC address format support (colon, hyphen, dot notation)
- Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) lookup and validation
- MAC address manufacturer identification
- Locally administered vs universally administered detection
- Multicast and broadcast MAC address handling
- MAC address generation and randomization
- EUI-48 and EUI-64 address operations
- MAC address pool management and allocation
- Address collision detection and validation
- Cross-platform MAC address handling
- Performance-optimized MAC operations
- MAC address debugging and diagnostic tools
- Custom MAC address validation rules
- Network interface MAC address management
- MAC address spoofing detection
- Address table management and operations
- Advanced MAC networking utilities
- MAC address format standardization
- Integration with network management systems

Physical Foundation:
MAC addresses are 48-bit identifiers assigned to network interface controllers
for communications at the data link layer. They consist of an OUI assigned
by IEEE and device-specific identifier, enabling unique identification of
network devices within broadcast domains.

Applications:
Network management systems, switch implementations, security applications,
Wake-on-LAN utilities, network discovery tools, asset management systems,
and any application requiring data link layer address manipulation.
