Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Implementation and Management

This module provides comprehensive TCP protocol implementation supporting
reliable, connection-oriented communication. Includes connection management,
congestion control, flow control, and advanced TCP features for custom
network stack implementations and protocol analysis.

Key Features:
- TCP connection establishment and termination (3-way handshake)
- Reliable data transmission with sequence numbers and acknowledgments
- Flow control using sliding window mechanism
- Congestion control algorithms (Reno, New Reno, CUBIC, BBR)
- TCP segment construction and parsing
- Window scaling and timestamp options
- Selective acknowledgment (SACK) support
- Fast retransmit and fast recovery mechanisms
- TCP keep-alive and dead connection detection
- Maximum segment size (MSS) negotiation
- TCP connection state management
- Retransmission timeout calculation
- TCP performance monitoring and tuning
- Connection multiplexing and demultiplexing
- TCP security extensions and authentication
- Packet loss detection and recovery
- TCP option handling and negotiation
- Cross-platform TCP compatibility
- Advanced TCP diagnostics and analysis
- Custom TCP implementation support

Physical Foundation:
TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data streams
between applications. It uses sequence numbers, acknowledgments, and
retransmission mechanisms to ensure data integrity and delivery, while
implementing congestion and flow control for network efficiency.

Applications:
Web servers and clients, email systems, file transfer protocols, database
connections, remote shell access, streaming services, and any application
requiring reliable data delivery with connection semantics.
