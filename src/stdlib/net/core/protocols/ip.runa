Internet Protocol (IP) Operations and Packet Management

This module provides comprehensive Internet Protocol (IP) implementation
supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. Includes packet construction,
header manipulation, routing operations, fragmentation handling, and
protocol-level networking capabilities for custom IP implementations.

Key Features:
- IPv4 and IPv6 packet construction and parsing
- IP header field manipulation and validation
- Packet fragmentation and reassembly operations
- IP routing table management and lookups
- IP address validation and conversion utilities
- Protocol number management and identification
- IP option handling and processing
- Checksum calculation and verification
- Time-to-Live (TTL) and Hop Limit management
- IP packet filtering and classification
- Quality of Service (QoS) field handling
- IP security and authentication support
- Packet inspection and analysis tools
- IP tunneling and encapsulation support
- Custom IP protocol implementation
- Network layer debugging and diagnostics
- IP performance monitoring and statistics
- Cross-platform IP compatibility
- IP packet injection and crafting
- Advanced IP networking features

Physical Foundation:
The Internet Protocol provides network layer addressing and routing services,
enabling packet delivery across interconnected networks. IP defines packet
structure, addressing schemes, and forwarding mechanisms that form the
foundation of modern internetworking.

Applications:
Network stack implementations, custom routers, VPN software, network
monitoring tools, protocol analyzers, security appliances, network
testing utilities, and specialized networking equipment.
