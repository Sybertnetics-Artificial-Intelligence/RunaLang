Domain Name System (DNS) Protocol Implementation and Resolution

This module provides comprehensive DNS protocol implementation supporting
domain name resolution, DNS query processing, and advanced DNS features.
Includes support for various record types, DNS caching, security extensions,
and custom DNS server implementations.

Key Features:
- DNS query construction and parsing for all record types
- Domain name resolution and reverse DNS lookup
- DNS caching and cache management
- DNS server implementation and query processing
- Support for A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, SRV, and other record types
- DNS zone file parsing and management
- DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) support
- DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH)
- Dynamic DNS updates and zone transfers
- DNS load balancing and failover
- Custom DNS record types and extensions
- DNS filtering and blocking capabilities
- DNS performance optimization and monitoring
- Cross-platform DNS compatibility
- DNS debugging and diagnostic tools
- Recursive and iterative DNS resolution
- DNS forwarding and proxy functionality
- Advanced DNS security features
- DNS analytics and reporting
- Multi-threaded DNS processing

Physical Foundation:
DNS provides hierarchical domain name resolution services that translate
human-readable domain names into IP addresses and other resource records.
It operates using a distributed database system with authoritative name
servers and caching mechanisms for efficient name resolution.

Applications:
Web browsers, email servers, network applications, DNS servers, network
monitoring tools, content delivery networks, load balancers, and any
application requiring domain name resolution services.
