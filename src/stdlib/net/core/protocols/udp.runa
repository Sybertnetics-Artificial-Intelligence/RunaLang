User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Implementation and Management

This module provides comprehensive UDP protocol implementation supporting
connectionless, unreliable datagram communication. Includes datagram
construction, parsing, and management for custom network stack implementations
and protocol analysis requiring lightweight transport services.

Key Features:
- UDP datagram construction and parsing
- Connectionless message transmission and reception
- UDP header field manipulation and validation
- Checksum calculation and verification
- Port number management and multiplexing
- UDP broadcast and multicast support
- Datagram size validation and handling
- Protocol-level error detection and reporting
- UDP performance monitoring and statistics
- Cross-platform UDP compatibility
- Custom UDP protocol extensions
- UDP security and filtering mechanisms
- Datagram fragmentation at application level
- UDP socket simulation and management
- Network byte order handling
- UDP debugging and diagnostics
- Quality of Service (QoS) support
- UDP tunneling and encapsulation
- Reliable UDP implementations (RUDP)
- Advanced UDP networking features

Physical Foundation:
UDP provides a simple, connectionless transport service that delivers
datagrams without guarantees of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.
It offers minimal protocol overhead making it suitable for applications
where speed and efficiency are more important than reliability.

Applications:
DNS queries, DHCP, streaming media, online gaming, IoT sensor data,
network discovery protocols, real-time applications, broadcast messaging,
and high-performance distributed systems requiring low latency.
