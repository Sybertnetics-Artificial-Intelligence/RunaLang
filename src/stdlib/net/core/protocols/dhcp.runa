Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Implementation and Management

This module provides comprehensive DHCP protocol implementation supporting
automatic IP address assignment, network configuration, and DHCP server
management. Includes DHCP client operations, server functionality, and
advanced DHCP features for network automation.

Key Features:
- DHCP client implementation for automatic configuration
- DHCP server functionality with IP address pool management
- DHCP message construction and parsing (DISCOVER, OFFER, REQUEST, ACK)
- IP address lease management and renewal
- DHCP option handling and custom option support
- Network parameter distribution (DNS, gateway, subnet mask)
- DHCP relay agent functionality
- Failover and high availability support
- DHCP reservation and static assignment
- Dynamic DNS integration with DHCP
- DHCP security and authentication features
- Performance monitoring and statistics
- Cross-platform DHCP compatibility
- DHCP debugging and diagnostic tools
- Advanced DHCP configuration management
- DHCP load balancing and scalability
- Integration with network management systems
- DHCP policy and access control
- Automated network provisioning
- DHCP protocol extensions and customization

Physical Foundation:
DHCP automates network configuration by dynamically assigning IP addresses
and network parameters to devices. It uses a client-server model with
lease-based address allocation, ensuring efficient utilization of IP
address space while providing centralized network configuration management.

Applications:
Corporate networks, home routers, ISP customer provisioning, data center
automation, cloud infrastructure, IoT device management, and any environment
requiring automated network configuration and IP address management.
