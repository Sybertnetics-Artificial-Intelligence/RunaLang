Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Implementation and Management

This module provides comprehensive ARP protocol implementation supporting
IP-to-MAC address resolution, ARP cache management, and network discovery.
Includes ARP request/reply handling, gratuitous ARP, proxy ARP, and advanced
ARP security features for local network communication.

Key Features:
- ARP request and reply message construction and parsing
- IP address to MAC address resolution and mapping
- ARP cache management with aging and expiration
- Gratuitous ARP for address conflict detection
- Proxy ARP functionality for network bridging
- ARP spoofing detection and prevention
- Static ARP entry management
- ARP table inspection and maintenance
- Network discovery using ARP scanning
- ARP security filtering and validation
- Cross-platform ARP compatibility
- ARP debugging and diagnostic tools
- Performance optimization for ARP operations
- ARP monitoring and statistics collection
- Custom ARP behavior and extensions
- ARP load balancing and failover
- Integration with network management systems
- ARP protocol compliance validation
- Advanced ARP networking features
- ARP-based network troubleshooting tools

Physical Foundation:
ARP resolves network layer addresses (IP) to link layer addresses (MAC)
within the same broadcast domain. It maintains a mapping table and uses
broadcast queries to discover hardware addresses, enabling proper frame
delivery in Ethernet and similar networks.

Applications:
Network stacks, switch implementations, network monitoring tools, security
appliances, network diagnostic utilities, and any system requiring IP-to-MAC
address resolution within local network segments.
