Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Implementation and Management

This module provides comprehensive ICMP protocol implementation supporting
network diagnostics, error reporting, and control message handling for both
IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Includes ping utilities, traceroute functionality,
and advanced ICMP message processing capabilities.

Key Features:
- ICMP message construction and parsing for IPv4 and IPv6
- Echo Request and Echo Reply message handling (ping)
- Destination unreachable and time exceeded messages
- Router advertisement and solicitation messages
- Network diagnostic tools and utilities
- ICMP error message generation and processing
- Path MTU discovery support
- Router discovery protocol implementation
- ICMP security filtering and validation
- Custom ICMP message types and extensions
- Network troubleshooting and analysis tools
- ICMP rate limiting and flood protection
- Cross-platform ICMP compatibility
- ICMP statistics collection and monitoring
- Advanced network diagnostic capabilities
- ICMP message routing and forwarding
- Network reachability testing
- ICMP debugging and analysis tools
- Protocol compliance and validation
- Performance optimization for ICMP operations

Physical Foundation:
ICMP provides essential network layer control and diagnostic services,
enabling error reporting, network diagnostics, and control message
communication between network devices. It operates at the network layer
and is integral to IP network functionality and troubleshooting.

Applications:
Network diagnostic tools (ping, traceroute), network monitoring systems,
router implementations, network troubleshooting utilities, path discovery
tools, and any application requiring network layer diagnostics and control.
