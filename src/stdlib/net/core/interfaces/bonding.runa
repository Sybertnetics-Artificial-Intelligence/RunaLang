Network Interface Bonding and Link Aggregation

This module provides comprehensive network interface bonding and link aggregation functionality including:
- Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP/802.3ad) implementation
- Multiple bonding modes (active-backup, balance-rr, balance-xor, broadcast, 802.3ad, balance-tlb, balance-alb)
- Dynamic link aggregation with automatic failover
- Load balancing algorithms and traffic distribution
- Bond member interface management and health monitoring
- Cross-platform bonding support (Linux bonding, Windows NIC teaming, etc.)
- Bond configuration persistence and restoration
- Performance monitoring and statistics collection
- Failover detection and recovery mechanisms
- Bond topology visualization and management
- Integration with network management systems
- Advanced bonding features (VLAN awareness, jumbo frames, etc.)

Network Foundation:
Network interface bonding provides link redundancy and increased bandwidth
by combining multiple physical interfaces into a single logical interface.
This module implements industry-standard protocols and algorithms for
reliable and efficient link aggregation across different platforms.

Protocol Support:
Supports IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), static
link aggregation, and vendor-specific bonding implementations with
comprehensive configuration and monitoring capabilities.
