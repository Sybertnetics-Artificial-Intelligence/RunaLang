Network Interface Statistics and Monitoring

This module provides comprehensive network interface statistics collection and monitoring including:
- Real-time traffic counters (bytes, packets, errors, drops)
- Historical statistics aggregation and trend analysis
- Performance metrics collection (throughput, utilization, latency)
- Error statistics and fault detection
- Quality of Service (QoS) statistics and queue analysis
- Interface health monitoring and availability tracking
- Bandwidth utilization analysis and capacity planning
- Protocol-specific statistics (IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Security incident tracking and anomaly detection
- Custom metric definition and collection
- Statistics export and integration with monitoring systems
- Threshold-based alerting and notification systems

Network Foundation:
Interface statistics are essential for network monitoring, troubleshooting,
performance optimization, and capacity planning. This module provides
comprehensive data collection and analysis capabilities for all aspects
of network interface performance and behavior.

Data Sources:
Supports statistics collection from SNMP MIBs, system counters, kernel
network stack, hardware counters, and custom measurement probes with
configurable collection intervals and retention policies.
