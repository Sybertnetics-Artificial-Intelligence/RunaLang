Network Interface Configuration Management

This module provides comprehensive network interface configuration functionality including:
- IP address assignment and management (IPv4, IPv6, dual-stack)
- Interface administrative and operational state management
- MTU, speed, and duplex configuration
- VLAN interface creation and management
- Bridge interface configuration and member management
- Bond/LAG interface configuration with load balancing
- Tunnel interface configuration (GRE, VXLAN, IPsec, etc.)
- QoS queue configuration and traffic shaping
- Interface security settings and access control
- Static route configuration per interface
- DHCP client configuration and lease management
- Interface naming and aliasing configuration

Network Foundation:
Interface configuration is fundamental to network connectivity and performance.
This module provides unified APIs for configuring all types of network
interfaces across different operating systems and platforms, ensuring
consistent behavior and comprehensive functionality.

Configuration Persistence:
Supports both temporary runtime configuration and persistent configuration
that survives system reboots, with proper validation and rollback
capabilities for safe configuration management.
