Network Interface Discovery and Enumeration

This module provides comprehensive network interface enumeration functionality including:
- Physical and virtual network interface discovery
- Interface type classification (Ethernet, WiFi, Loopback, Tunnel, Bond, VLAN)
- Hardware address (MAC) and interface name enumeration
- Interface capability detection and feature enumeration
- Network adapter and driver information retrieval
- Interface hierarchy and relationship mapping
- Cross-platform interface discovery (Windows, Linux, macOS, BSD)
- Container and virtual machine interface detection
- Interface state and operational status enumeration
- Network namespace and VRF interface discovery
- PCI device and USB network adapter enumeration
- Interface performance characteristics discovery

Network Foundation:
Interface enumeration is essential for network management, monitoring, and
configuration. This module provides platform-agnostic methods to discover
and characterize all network interfaces available to the system, including
their capabilities, relationships, and current operational state.

Platform Support:
Supports Windows WMI/Registry, Linux sysfs/netlink, macOS IOKit/ifconfig,
and BSD socket-based interface discovery with unified APIs that abstract
platform-specific implementation details.
