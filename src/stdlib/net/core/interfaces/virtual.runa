Virtual Network Interface Management

This module provides comprehensive virtual network interface management functionality including:
- VLAN interface creation, configuration, and management
- Virtual Ethernet (veth) pair creation for container networking
- TUN/TAP interface management for VPN and virtualization
- Bridge interface creation and management for Layer 2 switching
- Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) interface management
- Loopback interface configuration and management
- Dummy interface creation for testing and routing purposes
- Network namespace interface isolation and management
- Software-defined networking (SDN) virtual interfaces
- Virtual switch integration and management
- Container network interface (CNI) plugin support
- Virtual interface performance optimization and monitoring

Network Foundation:
Virtual network interfaces are essential for modern networking scenarios
including virtualization, containerization, VPNs, and software-defined
networks. This module provides comprehensive management capabilities for
all types of virtual interfaces across different platforms and use cases.

Virtualization Support:
Supports various virtualization platforms including KVM, VMware, Docker,
Kubernetes, and cloud providers with unified APIs for virtual interface
management and configuration.
