Network Load Balancing and Traffic Distribution

This module provides comprehensive network load balancing functionality including:
- Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing for traffic distribution
- Weighted load balancing with configurable traffic ratios
- Dynamic load balancing based on real-time link utilization
- Layer 3 and Layer 4 load balancing algorithms
- Geographic and proximity-based traffic steering
- Connection-aware load balancing for session persistence
- Health-based load balancing with automatic failover
- Bandwidth-aware traffic distribution
- Latency-optimized path selection and traffic routing
- Quality of Service (QoS) aware load balancing
- Anycast and multicast load distribution mechanisms
- Load balancing policy management and configuration

Network Foundation:
Load balancing is essential for optimal network resource utilization and
high availability. This module implements various algorithms for distributing
traffic across multiple paths, servers, or network segments while maintaining
performance, reliability, and service quality requirements.

Algorithm Support:
Supports round-robin, weighted round-robin, least connections, least response
time, hash-based, and custom algorithmic approaches with real-time adaptation
to network conditions and traffic patterns.
