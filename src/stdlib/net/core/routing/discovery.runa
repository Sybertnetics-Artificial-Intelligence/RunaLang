Network Route Discovery and Topology Management

This module provides comprehensive network route discovery and topology mapping including:
- Dynamic route discovery using various algorithms (OSPF, RIP, EIGRP, BGP)
- Network topology detection and mapping
- Link state advertisement processing
- Distance vector routing protocol support
- Path vector protocol implementation
- Network neighbor discovery and maintenance  
- Routing protocol convergence optimization
- Multi-area and hierarchical routing support
- Route authentication and security validation
- Routing protocol metrics calculation and comparison
- Network topology change detection and adaptation
- Inter-domain routing and policy enforcement

Network Foundation:
Route discovery protocols are essential for dynamic network adaptation and
optimal path selection. This module implements major routing protocol
algorithms and provides unified interfaces for topology management across
different network architectures and scales.

Protocol Support:
Supports interior gateway protocols (OSPF, RIP, EIGRP, IS-IS) and exterior
gateway protocols (BGP, EGP) with full RFC compliance and modern extensions
for IPv6, MPLS, and software-defined networking environments.
