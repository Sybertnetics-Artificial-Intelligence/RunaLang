Network Failover and Redundancy Management

This module provides comprehensive network failover and redundancy functionality including:
- Automatic failover detection and switchover mechanisms
- Primary-backup and active-active redundancy configurations
- Link aggregation and bonding for interface redundancy
- Gateway redundancy protocols (VRRP, HSRP, GLBP)
- Path redundancy with backup route selection
- Service redundancy and high availability management
- Heartbeat and keepalive monitoring systems
- Graceful degradation and service continuation strategies
- Split-brain detection and prevention mechanisms
- Disaster recovery and network continuity planning
- Failover time optimization and sub-second recovery
- Cross-datacenter and geographic redundancy support

Network Foundation:
Network failover is critical for maintaining service availability and
business continuity. This module implements various redundancy mechanisms
from simple link backup to complex multi-site disaster recovery scenarios
with automatic detection, decision making, and recovery procedures.

Failover Types:
Supports hot standby, warm standby, and cold standby configurations with
configurable detection thresholds, switchover criteria, and recovery
procedures tailored to specific availability requirements and RTO/RPO targets.
