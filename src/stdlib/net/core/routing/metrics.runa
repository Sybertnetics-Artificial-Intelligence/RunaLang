Network Routing Metrics and Path Selection

This module provides comprehensive routing metrics calculation and path selection including:
- Multi-criteria path evaluation and selection algorithms
- Dynamic metric calculation based on real-time network conditions
- Bandwidth, latency, jitter, packet loss, and reliability metrics
- Cost-based routing with administrative and operational costs
- Quality of Service (QoS) metrics integration
- Traffic engineering metrics for optimal path utilization
- Routing protocol specific metrics (OSPF cost, RIP hop count, EIGRP composite)
- Load-aware metrics for congestion-sensitive routing
- Predictive metrics using historical performance data
- Custom metric definition and composite scoring algorithms
- Path diversity metrics for multipath routing decisions
- Network topology awareness for metric calculations

Network Foundation:
Routing metrics are fundamental to intelligent path selection in networks.
This module implements sophisticated metric calculation and comparison
algorithms that consider multiple factors simultaneously to make optimal
routing decisions based on network policies and performance requirements.

Metric Types:
Supports static metrics (configured values), dynamic metrics (real-time
measurements), predictive metrics (historical analysis), and composite
metrics (combining multiple factors) with flexible weighting and
normalization capabilities.
