Network Routing Table Operations

This module provides comprehensive routing table management functionality including:
- Routing table creation, modification, and deletion operations
- Route entry management with metrics and preferences
- Multi-protocol routing table support (IPv4, IPv6, MPLS)
- Routing table lookup operations with longest prefix matching
- Route aggregation and summarization algorithms
- Routing table synchronization between network devices
- Policy-based routing table modifications
- Route redistribution between different routing protocols
- Routing table backup, restore, and versioning
- Performance-optimized routing table data structures
- Concurrent access control for routing table operations
- Route validation and consistency checking

Network Foundation:
Routing tables are fundamental network data structures that determine packet
forwarding decisions. This module provides both basic CRUD operations and
advanced routing algorithms including policy routing, traffic engineering,
and multi-topology routing support.

Performance Considerations:
Implements optimized data structures like Patricia tries, radix trees, and
hash tables for fast route lookups. Supports parallel route processing and
distributed routing table management across network infrastructure.
