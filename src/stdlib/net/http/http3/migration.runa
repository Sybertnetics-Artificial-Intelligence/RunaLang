HTTP/3 Connection Migration and Mobility Support

This module implements HTTP/3 connection migration capabilities using
QUIC's connection migration features to maintain HTTP/3 connections
across network changes, IP address changes, and path switches for
improved connectivity and user experience.

Key Features:
- Connection migration initiation and management
- Path validation and verification
- IP address change handling
- Network interface switching support
- NAT rebinding detection and handling
- Mobile device connectivity management
- Failover and redundant path support
- Migration performance optimization
- Connection state preservation
- Migration security validation
- Bandwidth optimization across paths
- Migration debugging and monitoring

Technical Foundation:
Based on QUIC connection migration (RFC 9000) with HTTP/3 specific
considerations for maintaining application-level connections across
network changes and mobility scenarios.

Applications:
Critical for mobile applications, edge computing, multi-homed hosts,
and any HTTP/3 application requiring connection resilience across
network topology changes and mobility scenarios.
