HTTP/3 Header Processing with QPACK

This module implements HTTP/3 header processing using QPACK (QPACK 
Header Compression) including header encoding, decoding, dynamic table
management, and integration with HTTP/3 streams for efficient header
compression in HTTP/3 connections.

Key Features:
- QPACK header compression and decompression
- Dynamic table management for header compression
- Static table handling for common headers
- Header block encoding and decoding
- Encoder and decoder stream management
- Header field indexing and references
- Compression context synchronization
- Error handling for header processing
- Header security validation
- Performance optimization for header processing
- Header debugging and analysis
- Compression ratio monitoring

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9204 (QPACK) specification with integration to HTTP/3
streams for efficient header compression with dynamic table management
and proper error handling for reliable header processing.

Applications:
Critical for HTTP/3 implementations requiring efficient header
compression to reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance
over QUIC transport with proper QPACK integration.
