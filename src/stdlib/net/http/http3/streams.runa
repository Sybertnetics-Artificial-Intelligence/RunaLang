HTTP/3 Stream Management and Processing

This module provides HTTP/3 specific stream management including
unidirectional and bidirectional streams, stream types, HTTP/3
frame processing over QUIC streams, and the mapping between
HTTP semantics and QUIC stream operations.

Key Features:
- HTTP/3 stream type management (request, control, push, QPACK)
- Bidirectional request/response streams
- Unidirectional control and data streams
- HTTP/3 frame processing over QUIC streams
- Stream multiplexing and concurrency control
- Stream priority and dependency handling
- Stream flow control integration with QUIC
- Stream error handling and recovery
- Stream lifecycle management
- Stream performance optimization
- Stream debugging and monitoring
- Stream resource cleanup

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9114 (HTTP/3) stream model with proper mapping to
QUIC transport streams, frame processing, and HTTP/3 specific
stream types and management requirements.

Applications:
Essential for HTTP/3 implementations requiring proper stream
management over QUIC transport with HTTP/3 semantics and
frame processing capabilities.
