HTTP/3 Datagram Support and Processing

This module implements HTTP/3 datagram support using QUIC DATAGRAM
frames for unreliable, low-latency data transmission suitable for
real-time applications, gaming, media streaming, and other use cases
requiring fast delivery over reliability.

Key Features:
- QUIC DATAGRAM frame processing for HTTP/3
- Unreliable datagram transmission and reception
- Low-latency datagram delivery
- Datagram size management and limits
- Flow control integration for datagrams
- Datagram multiplexing over HTTP/3 connections
- Real-time application support
- Datagram priority and scheduling
- Error handling for lost datagrams
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Datagram debugging and analysis
- Integration with HTTP/3 request/response model

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9221 (QUIC DATAGRAM Extension) with HTTP/3 integration
for unreliable data transmission over QUIC connections optimized
for low-latency applications requiring fast delivery.

Applications:
Ideal for real-time applications, gaming, live media streaming,
IoT data transmission, and any HTTP/3 application requiring
low-latency data delivery where reliability can be traded for speed.
