HTTP/3 QUIC Protocol Integration

This module provides HTTP/3 integration with the QUIC transport protocol
including connection establishment, stream management, packet handling,
and the QUIC-specific features that enable HTTP/3 communication
over UDP with built-in security and reliability.

Key Features:
- QUIC connection establishment and handshake
- QUIC stream management for HTTP/3
- QUIC packet processing and reliability
- Connection migration and path validation
- QUIC congestion control integration
- 0-RTT connection establishment
- Connection multiplexing and ID management
- QUIC error handling and recovery
- Packet encryption and security
- Path MTU discovery and handling
- QUIC version negotiation
- Performance monitoring and optimization

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9000 (QUIC) and RFC 9114 (HTTP/3) specifications with
proper QUIC transport integration for HTTP/3 over UDP with enhanced
security, performance, and reliability features.

Applications:
Essential for HTTP/3 implementations requiring QUIC transport
integration for modern web communication with improved performance,
security, and connection resilience over UDP.
