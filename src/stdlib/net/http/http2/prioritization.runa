HTTP/2 Stream Prioritization and Scheduling

This module implements HTTP/2 stream prioritization including priority
trees, dependency management, weight-based scheduling, and resource
allocation to optimize delivery of multiplexed streams based on
their relative importance and dependencies.

Key Features:
- Stream priority tree construction and management
- Weight-based stream scheduling
- Stream dependency handling
- Priority inheritance and propagation
- Dynamic priority adjustment
- Fair resource allocation algorithms
- Priority-aware flow control integration
- Stream scheduling optimization
- Priority debugging and visualization
- Performance-based priority adaptation
- Client priority hint integration
- Server-side priority override capabilities

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9113 (HTTP/2) priority model with dependency trees,
weight-based scheduling, and fair resource allocation for optimal
stream delivery order and resource utilization.

Applications:
Critical for HTTP/2 performance optimization by ensuring important
resources are delivered first, improving perceived page load times
and user experience in multiplexed HTTP/2 connections.
