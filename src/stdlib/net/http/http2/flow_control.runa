HTTP/2 Flow Control and Window Management

This module implements HTTP/2 flow control mechanisms including window
size management, flow control enforcement, and backpressure handling
to prevent buffer overflow and ensure fair resource distribution
across multiplexed streams as specified in RFC 9113.

Key Features:
- Connection and stream-level flow control
- Window size tracking and management
- WINDOW_UPDATE frame processing
- Flow control violation detection
- Backpressure handling and buffering
- Adaptive window sizing
- Flow control optimization
- Congestion control integration
- Fair bandwidth allocation
- Flow control metrics and monitoring
- Dynamic window adjustment
- Flow control debugging and analysis

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9113 (HTTP/2) flow control model with proper window
management, backpressure handling, and resource allocation for
preventing congestion and ensuring fair stream treatment.

Applications:
Critical for HTTP/2 implementations to prevent buffer overflow,
manage network congestion, and ensure fair resource allocation
in high-throughput multiplexed HTTP/2 connections.
