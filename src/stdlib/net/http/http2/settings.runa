HTTP/2 Settings Management and Configuration

This module handles HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames and connection configuration
including parameter negotiation, settings validation, acknowledgment
processing, and dynamic configuration updates for HTTP/2 connections
as specified in RFC 9113.

Key Features:
- SETTINGS frame processing and acknowledgment
- Connection parameter negotiation
- Settings validation and enforcement
- Dynamic settings updates
- Settings synchronization between peers
- Default settings management
- Settings history and rollback
- Performance-based settings optimization
- Settings compatibility checking
- Settings debugging and monitoring
- Custom settings parameter support
- Settings policy enforcement

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9113 (HTTP/2) SETTINGS frame specification with proper
parameter validation, acknowledgment handling, and connection state
management for reliable HTTP/2 configuration.

Applications:
Essential for HTTP/2 connection establishment, parameter negotiation,
and runtime configuration updates in HTTP/2 clients, servers,
and intermediaries.
