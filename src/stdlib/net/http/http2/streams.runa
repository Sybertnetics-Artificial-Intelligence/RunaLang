HTTP/2 Stream Management and Multiplexing

This module provides comprehensive HTTP/2 stream management including
stream lifecycle, multiplexing, state management, and coordination
of multiple concurrent streams over a single HTTP/2 connection
as specified in RFC 9113.

Key Features:
- Complete HTTP/2 stream lifecycle management
- Stream state machine implementation (idle, open, closed, etc.)
- Stream multiplexing and concurrent request handling
- Stream priority and dependency management
- Stream flow control integration
- Stream error handling and recovery
- Stream metrics and monitoring
- Stream resource management and cleanup
- Stream synchronization and coordination
- Stream cancellation and reset handling
- Bidirectional stream communication
- Stream performance optimization

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9113 (HTTP/2) stream model with proper state machine
implementation, concurrent stream handling, and resource management
for efficient HTTP/2 multiplexing and communication.

Applications:
Essential for HTTP/2 implementations requiring concurrent request
processing, stream multiplexing, and efficient connection utilization
in modern web servers, clients, and proxy implementations.
