HTTP/2 Frame Processing and Protocol Implementation

This module provides comprehensive HTTP/2 frame processing including
frame parsing, serialization, validation, and all frame type handling
as specified in RFC 9113. Implements the complete HTTP/2 framing layer
for both client and server implementations.

Key Features:
- Complete HTTP/2 frame parsing and serialization
- All frame types: DATA, HEADERS, PRIORITY, RST_STREAM, SETTINGS, etc.
- Frame validation and error detection
- Binary frame format handling with proper encoding
- Frame size limits and flow control integration
- Frame priority and dependency processing
- Connection and stream frame routing
- Frame compression and header compression integration
- Frame sequence validation and protocol compliance
- Frame debugging and inspection utilities
- Performance optimized frame processing
- Memory efficient frame handling

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9113 (HTTP/2) specification with complete implementation
of the HTTP/2 binary framing protocol including all frame types,
flags, and processing rules for reliable HTTP/2 communication.

Applications:
Essential for HTTP/2 clients, servers, proxies, and any application
requiring HTTP/2 protocol support with proper frame handling and
RFC compliance for modern web communication.
