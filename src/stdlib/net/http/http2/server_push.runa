HTTP/2 Server Push Implementation

This module implements HTTP/2 server push functionality allowing servers
to proactively send resources to clients before they are requested,
improving page load performance by eliminating round-trips for
predictable resource dependencies.

Key Features:
- Server push initiation and management
- PUSH_PROMISE frame handling
- Push stream lifecycle management
- Resource prediction and selection
- Push policy configuration and enforcement
- Client push acceptance and rejection
- Push cache integration
- Push performance optimization
- Push resource prioritization
- Push cancellation and cleanup
- Push metrics and monitoring
- Intelligent push strategies

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9113 (HTTP/2) server push specification with proper
PUSH_PROMISE frame handling, stream management, and resource
optimization for improved web performance.

Applications:
Used by HTTP/2 servers to optimize page load times by proactively
pushing resources like CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets
that clients will likely need.
