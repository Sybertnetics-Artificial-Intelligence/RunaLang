HTTP Pipelining Implementation

This module provides comprehensive HTTP pipelining functionality including:
- HTTP/1.1 request pipelining with proper ordering and response correlation
- Integration with keep-alive protocol layer for persistent connection management
- Pipeline request queue management with configurable depth and timeout policies
- Response ordering and delivery to maintain request-response correlation
- Pipeline flow control and backpressure management for optimal throughput
- Pipeline performance optimization with intelligent request batching strategies
- Pipeline error handling and recovery with request retry and failover mechanisms
- Pipeline security validation and request sanitization for safe operation
- Pipeline monitoring and metrics collection for performance analysis
- Integration with connection pooling and load balancing for optimal distribution
- Pipeline compatibility detection and graceful fallback to sequential processing
- Request prioritization and quality-of-service management within pipelines
- Pipeline congestion control and adaptive throughput management
- Pipeline connection draining and graceful shutdown for maintenance operations
- Compliance with HTTP/1.1 pipelining specifications and best practices

Key Features:
- RFC 2616 compliant HTTP/1.1 pipelining with proper response ordering
- Intelligent pipeline management with configurable depth and flow control
- Advanced error recovery and retry mechanisms for pipeline reliability
- Performance optimization through request batching and connection reuse
- Security-aware pipelining with request validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive monitoring and analytics for pipeline effectiveness
- Integration with modern HTTP features and connection management systems
- Graceful degradation and fallback for non-pipelining-capable clients

Pipeline Foundation:
Built on efficient request queuing and response correlation algorithms
that maximize connection utilization while maintaining HTTP semantic
correctness and providing significant performance improvements for
request-heavy applications through reduced round-trip latency.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-throughput scenarios with intelligent request
batching, efficient memory management, and minimal processing
overhead to maximize the performance benefits of pipelining
while maintaining reliability and correctness.
