HTTP Load Balancing and Traffic Distribution

This module provides comprehensive HTTP load balancing functionality including:
- Multiple load balancing algorithms (round-robin, weighted, least connections, IP hash)
- Dynamic health checking and automatic server failover with recovery
- Sticky sessions and session affinity management for stateful applications
- Geographic load balancing and proximity-based routing optimization
- Real-time traffic distribution with adaptive load balancing algorithms
- Server capacity management and auto-scaling integration
- Quality of Service (QoS) enforcement and traffic prioritization
- Circuit breaker integration for fault tolerance and cascade failure prevention
- Performance-based routing with latency and throughput optimization
- SSL termination and certificate management at load balancer level
- WebSocket connection balancing with session persistence
- API rate limiting and throttling at the load balancer tier
- Traffic shaping and bandwidth management with configurable policies
- Load balancer monitoring and analytics with detailed performance metrics
- Multi-tier load balancing with hierarchical distribution strategies

Key Features:
- Advanced load balancing algorithms with intelligent traffic distribution
- Comprehensive health monitoring with configurable check intervals
- Session persistence and sticky session management
- Geographic and latency-aware routing capabilities
- Integration with auto-scaling and capacity management systems
- SSL/TLS termination with certificate lifecycle management
- Real-time performance monitoring and alerting
- Circuit breaker and fault tolerance mechanisms

Distribution Foundation:
Built on high-performance networking stack with minimal latency
overhead, supporting thousands of concurrent connections with
intelligent routing decisions based on real-time server health,
capacity, and performance metrics for optimal traffic distribution.

Scalability Considerations:
Designed for massive scale with support for large server farms,
distributed load balancing across multiple data centers, and
intelligent traffic routing that adapts to changing conditions
while maintaining consistent performance and availability.
