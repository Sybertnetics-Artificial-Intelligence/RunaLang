HTTP Performance Caching Implementation

This module provides comprehensive HTTP caching functionality including:
- Multi-level caching architecture with memory, disk, and distributed layers
- HTTP cache header processing and validation (ETag, Last-Modified, Cache-Control)
- Cache invalidation strategies and dependency management
- Content-aware caching with compression and encoding support
- Cache warming and prefetching mechanisms for improved performance
- Cache analytics and monitoring with hit rate optimization
- Cache coherence and consistency management across distributed systems
- Smart cache replacement policies (LRU, LFU, adaptive algorithms)
- Cache partitioning and sharding for scalable storage
- Integration with CDN and edge caching networks
- Cache security and access control mechanisms
- Performance optimization through intelligent cache sizing
- Cache serialization and persistence for durability
- Real-time cache metrics and performance monitoring
- Automated cache tuning and optimization recommendations

Key Features:
- RFC 7234 compliant HTTP caching with full header support
- Multi-tier caching architecture for optimal performance
- Intelligent cache invalidation and dependency tracking
- Advanced cache replacement algorithms and optimization
- Distributed caching with consistency guarantees
- Integration with CDN and edge computing platforms
- Comprehensive monitoring and analytics capabilities
- Security features including cache poisoning protection

Performance Foundation:
Built on high-performance caching algorithms and data structures,
providing sub-millisecond cache access times with intelligent
memory management and optimization to maximize cache hit rates
while minimizing memory footprint and storage overhead.

Scalability Considerations:
Designed for horizontal scalability with distributed caching
support, consistent hashing, and replication strategies to
ensure cache performance and availability across large-scale
distributed systems and high-traffic environments.
