HTTP Keep-Alive Connection Management

This module provides comprehensive HTTP keep-alive protocol functionality including:
- HTTP keep-alive header processing and negotiation with client capabilities
- Keep-alive parameter negotiation and protocol compliance (RFC 2616)
- Connection persistence validation and reuse eligibility assessment
- Keep-alive timeout management and connection lifecycle control
- Connection state tracking and validation for protocol compliance
- Keep-alive connection monitoring and health verification
- Performance metrics collection for keep-alive connection effectiveness
- Keep-alive connection security validation and access control
- Protocol-level connection cleanup and resource management
- Integration interface for higher-level connection management (pools, load balancers)
- Connection drain and graceful shutdown for maintenance operations
- Keep-alive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Compliance validation and protocol specification enforcement
- Client-server capability negotiation and parameter optimization
- Connection reuse optimization for reduced establishment overhead

Key Features:
- RFC 2616 compliant HTTP/1.1 persistent connection protocol implementation
- HTTP keep-alive header parsing, validation, and response generation
- Protocol-level connection reuse eligibility assessment and validation
- Configurable timeout policies and parameter negotiation
- Connection state tracking and lifecycle management at protocol level
- Integration interface for higher-level connection management layers
- Security-aware protocol validation and compliance enforcement
- Detailed protocol-level metrics and effectiveness analysis

Protocol Foundation:
Built on efficient HTTP keep-alive protocol implementation that
provides the foundation for connection reuse optimization,
offering a clean interface for higher-level connection management
systems while ensuring strict RFC compliance and security.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-throughput environments with minimal protocol
overhead, providing efficient keep-alive header processing and
connection state validation that can be leveraged by connection
pools, load balancers, and other connection management systems.
