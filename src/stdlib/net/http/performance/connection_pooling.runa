HTTP Connection Pooling and Management

This module provides comprehensive HTTP connection pooling functionality including:
- Intelligent connection pool management with adaptive sizing and lifecycle control
- Integration with keep-alive protocol layer for optimal connection reuse
- Multi-host connection pooling with per-host limits and load balancing
- Connection health monitoring and automatic recovery from failed connections
- SSL/TLS connection pooling with certificate validation and session reuse
- HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connection multiplexing and stream management
- Connection priority management and quality-of-service enforcement
- Pool warming and connection pre-establishment for reduced latency
- Connection metrics and performance monitoring with detailed analytics
- Graceful connection draining and pool shutdown with request completion
- Connection security features including IP filtering and rate limiting
- Integration with circuit breakers and retry mechanisms
- Memory-efficient connection management with configurable limits
- Cross-datacenter connection optimization and geographic routing
- Real-time connection pool tuning based on traffic patterns

Key Features:
- Advanced connection lifecycle management with health monitoring
- Layered architecture with keep-alive protocol integration for optimal reuse
- Intelligent pool sizing based on traffic patterns and performance metrics
- Multi-protocol support (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSocket) with unified management
- Security-aware connection handling with TLS optimization
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for connection pool health
- Integration with load balancing and service discovery systems
- Performance optimization through connection reuse and multiplexing
- Fault tolerance with automatic recovery and circuit breaker integration

Performance Foundation:
Built on high-performance networking primitives with efficient
memory management and minimal overhead per connection,
leveraging the keep-alive protocol layer for optimal connection
reuse while providing intelligent pool-level resource management.

Scalability Considerations:
Designed for massive scale with support for thousands of
concurrent connections per pool, intelligent resource
management, and adaptive algorithms that optimize
performance under varying load conditions.
