HTTP Server CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Support

This module provides comprehensive CORS implementation for HTTP servers
including preflight request handling, origin validation, header
management, and security controls for enabling safe cross-origin
requests in web applications while maintaining security.

Key Features:
- CORS preflight request handling (OPTIONS)
- Origin validation and whitelist management
- Allowed methods and headers configuration
- Credentials and cookie support in cross-origin requests
- Custom CORS headers and exposure control
- Wildcard and pattern-based origin matching
- Per-route CORS configuration
- Security-first CORS policy enforcement
- CORS error handling and debugging
- Performance optimization for CORS checks
- CORS compliance with W3C specifications
- Integration with authentication systems

Technical Foundation:
Implements W3C CORS specification (RFC 6454) with proper preflight
handling, security controls, and flexible configuration for safe
cross-origin resource sharing in web applications.

Applications:
Essential for web APIs, single-page applications, microservices,
and any HTTP server requiring cross-origin access while maintaining
security boundaries and preventing unauthorized access.
