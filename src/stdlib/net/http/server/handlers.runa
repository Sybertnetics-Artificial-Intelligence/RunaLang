HTTP Server Request Handlers and Middleware

This module provides comprehensive request handler management including
handler registration, middleware chains, request/response processing,
and the foundation for building scalable HTTP server applications
with proper separation of concerns and middleware composition.

Key Features:
- Request handler registration and management
- Middleware chain composition and execution
- Handler context management and data passing
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Asynchronous handler support
- Handler performance monitoring
- Request/response transformation utilities
- Handler dependency injection
- Handler lifecycle management
- Custom handler factories and builders
- Handler testing and validation utilities
- Handler documentation and introspection

Technical Foundation:
Implements handler patterns with proper middleware composition,
error propagation, and resource management following modern
web application architecture patterns for maintainable applications.

Applications:
Foundation for web frameworks, REST APIs, microservices, and
HTTP applications requiring structured request processing with
middleware support and proper error handling mechanisms.
