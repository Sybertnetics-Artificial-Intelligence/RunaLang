HTTP Server Request Logging and Access Monitoring

This module provides comprehensive HTTP request logging and access
monitoring for HTTP servers including access logs, error logs,
performance monitoring, log formatting, and audit trails for
debugging, monitoring, and compliance requirements.

Key Features:
- Comprehensive access logging (Common Log Format, Extended)
- Error logging and exception tracking
- Request/response timing and performance metrics
- Custom log formatting and structured logging
- Log rotation and retention management
- Real-time log streaming and monitoring
- Security event logging and audit trails
- Request correlation and tracing
- Log filtering and sampling for high-traffic
- Integration with external logging systems
- Privacy-aware logging with data sanitization
- Log analytics and pattern detection

Technical Foundation:
Implements standard logging formats (CLF, ECLF, JSON) with configurable
output, efficient buffering, and integration with monitoring systems
for comprehensive HTTP server observability.

Applications:
Essential for production HTTP servers requiring monitoring,
debugging, compliance, security auditing, and performance
analysis of web traffic and server behavior.
