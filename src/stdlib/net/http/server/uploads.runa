HTTP Server File Upload Processing

This module provides comprehensive file upload handling for HTTP servers
including multipart form parsing, file validation, streaming uploads,
progress tracking, and security controls for safe and efficient
file upload processing in web applications.

Key Features:
- Multipart form data parsing and processing
- File upload validation and security scanning  
- Streaming uploads for large files
- Upload progress tracking and reporting
- File type validation and MIME type detection
- File size limits and quota management
- Temporary file handling and cleanup
- Upload resumption for interrupted transfers
- Virus scanning and content validation
- Upload metadata extraction
- Bandwidth throttling for uploads
- Multiple file upload batch processing

Technical Foundation:
Implements RFC 7578 (multipart/form-data) and RFC 1867 with proper
boundary parsing, file stream handling, and security controls for
robust file upload processing in HTTP servers.

Applications:
Essential for web applications requiring file uploads including
document management, image galleries, media uploads, and any HTTP
server needing secure file upload capabilities.
