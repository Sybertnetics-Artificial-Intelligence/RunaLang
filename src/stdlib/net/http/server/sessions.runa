HTTP Server Session Management

This module provides comprehensive session management for HTTP servers
including session creation, storage, validation, and cleanup with support
for various storage backends, security features, and session lifecycle
management for stateful web applications.

Key Features:
- Session creation and unique ID generation
- Multiple session storage backends (memory, database, files)
- Session data serialization and deserialization
- Session expiration and automatic cleanup
- Session security with CSRF protection
- Session hijacking prevention
- Concurrent session access handling
- Session migration and replication
- Custom session cookie configuration
- Session analytics and monitoring
- Distributed session management
- Session-based authentication integration

Technical Foundation:
Implements secure session management with cryptographically secure
session IDs, proper expiration handling, and configurable storage
backends for scalable stateful web applications.

Applications:
Essential for web applications requiring user state management,
shopping carts, user preferences, multi-step forms, and any HTTP
server needing stateful user interactions.
