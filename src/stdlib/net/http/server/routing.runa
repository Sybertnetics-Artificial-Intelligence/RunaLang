HTTP Server URL Routing and Path Matching

This module provides comprehensive URL routing functionality for HTTP servers
including path pattern matching, route registration, parameter extraction,
and request dispatching to appropriate handlers based on URL patterns
and HTTP methods.

Key Features:
- Flexible URL pattern matching with parameters
- HTTP method-based routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Wildcard and regex pattern support
- Route parameter extraction and validation
- Nested route groups and middleware
- Route priority and conflict resolution
- Dynamic route registration and modification
- Route caching for performance optimization
- RESTful routing conventions and helpers
- Route documentation and introspection
- Route versioning and API evolution support
- Custom route matching and handler selection

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient routing algorithms with trie-based pattern matching,
parameter extraction, and handler dispatch optimized for high-performance
HTTP request routing in web servers and API gateways.

Applications:
Essential for web frameworks, REST APIs, microservices, and any HTTP
server requiring sophisticated URL-based request routing and handler
dispatch with parameter extraction and method-based filtering.
