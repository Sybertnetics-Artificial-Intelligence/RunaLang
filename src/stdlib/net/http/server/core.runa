HTTP Server Core Implementation and Request Handling

This module provides the core HTTP server functionality including request
processing, response generation, connection management, and the fundamental
server lifecycle operations. Forms the foundation for all HTTP server
implementations with proper RFC compliance and modern features.

Key Features:
- Complete HTTP server implementation with multi-protocol support
- Request parsing and response generation
- Connection lifecycle management and keep-alive support
- Multi-threaded request processing with worker pools
- HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 protocol support
- Virtual host and multi-domain handling
- Request routing and handler dispatch
- Error handling and status page generation
- Server metrics and health monitoring
- Graceful startup and shutdown procedures
- Resource management and connection limits
- Security controls and request validation

Technical Foundation:
Built on RFC 9110 (HTTP Semantics), RFC 9112 (HTTP/1.1), RFC 9113 (HTTP/2),
and HTTP/3 specifications with proper connection handling, state management,
and resource utilization for production-grade HTTP server operations.

Applications:
Essential foundation for web servers, API servers, reverse proxies,
microservices, and any application requiring robust HTTP server
functionality with enterprise-grade reliability and performance.
