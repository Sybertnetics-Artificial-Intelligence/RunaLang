HTTP Server Authentication and Authorization

This module provides comprehensive authentication and authorization
capabilities for HTTP servers including multiple authentication schemes,
user management, role-based access control, token management, and
security enforcement for protected web resources.

Key Features:
- Multiple authentication schemes (Basic, Digest, Bearer, OAuth)
- JWT token generation, validation, and management
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Permission management and enforcement
- User authentication and credential validation
- Session-based authentication integration
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- API key authentication and management
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect integration
- LDAP and Active Directory integration
- Authentication middleware and filters
- Security event logging and audit trails

Technical Foundation:
Implements RFC 7617 (Basic), RFC 7616 (Digest), RFC 6750 (Bearer),
OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect specifications with proper security
controls, token management, and access enforcement.

Applications:
Essential for web applications requiring user authentication, API
security, protected resources, and any HTTP server needing access
control and security enforcement capabilities.
