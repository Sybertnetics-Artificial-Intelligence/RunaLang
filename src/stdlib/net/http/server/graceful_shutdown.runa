HTTP Server Graceful Shutdown Management

This module provides comprehensive graceful shutdown capabilities for
HTTP servers including connection draining, request completion,
resource cleanup, and coordinated shutdown procedures to ensure
reliable server termination without data loss or request interruption.

Key Features:
- Graceful connection draining and completion
- Active request tracking and completion waiting
- Configurable shutdown timeout and phases
- Resource cleanup and connection closing
- Health check integration during shutdown
- Load balancer coordination and traffic routing
- Database connection cleanup and transaction completion  
- File handle and resource management
- Shutdown signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- Metrics collection during shutdown process
- Emergency shutdown procedures for critical failures
- Integration with process managers and orchestrators

Technical Foundation:
Implements proper shutdown sequence with connection tracking,
resource cleanup, and timeout management for reliable server
termination in production environments.

Applications:
Essential for production HTTP servers requiring zero-downtime
deployments, graceful maintenance, and reliable service shutdown
in containerized and orchestrated environments.
