HTTP Server Static File Serving

This module provides comprehensive static file serving capabilities for
HTTP servers including file system integration, MIME type detection,
range request support, compression, caching headers, and security
controls for efficient and secure static content delivery.

Key Features:
- Static file serving with proper MIME type detection
- File system integration and path resolution
- Range request support for large files and media
- Automatic compression for supported file types
- Cache-Control header generation for static assets
- ETag generation and conditional request support
- Directory listing and index file handling
- Security controls and path traversal protection
- Performance optimization with sendfile support
- Custom error pages and fallback handling
- Content negotiation for multiple file formats
- Static asset bundling and optimization

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient file serving with proper HTTP semantics, security
controls, and performance optimizations including range requests,
compression, and caching for scalable static content delivery.

Applications:
Essential for web servers serving static assets like HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, images, documents, and media files with proper HTTP
semantics and performance optimization.
