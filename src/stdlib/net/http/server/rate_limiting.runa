HTTP Server Rate Limiting and Throttling

This module provides comprehensive rate limiting and request throttling
capabilities for HTTP servers including various limiting algorithms,
client identification, quota management, and DoS protection for
maintaining service availability and preventing abuse.

Key Features:
- Multiple rate limiting algorithms (Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Sliding Window)
- Client identification and tracking (IP, User, API Key)
- Request quota management and enforcement
- Distributed rate limiting for load balancing
- Adaptive rate limiting based on server load
- Rate limiting bypass for trusted clients
- Custom rate limiting rules and policies
- DDoS protection and mitigation
- Rate limiting analytics and monitoring
- Graceful degradation under high load
- Rate limiting header communication
- Burst handling and peak load management

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient rate limiting algorithms with proper client
tracking, distributed coordination, and performance optimization
for scalable request throttling and abuse prevention.

Applications:
Essential for public APIs, web services, high-traffic websites,
and any HTTP server requiring protection against abuse, ensuring
fair resource usage and service availability.
