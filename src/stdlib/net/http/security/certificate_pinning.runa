Certificate and Public Key Pinning Implementation

This module provides comprehensive certificate pinning functionality including:
- Certificate pinning implementation and validation mechanisms
- Public key pinning with multiple key formats and algorithms
- HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) header generation and processing
- Dynamic pinning configuration and runtime validation
- Pin failure detection and recovery procedures
- Certificate transparency integration and monitoring
- Backup pin management and rotation strategies
- Pinning bypass detection and security monitoring
- Certificate chain validation with pinned constraints
- Performance-optimized pinning validation routines
- Multi-level pinning strategies (leaf, intermediate, root)
- Pinning violation reporting and incident response
- Integration with certificate lifecycle management
- Automated pin generation and deployment workflows
- Comprehensive pinning policy management and enforcement

Key Features:
- Support for multiple pinning strategies and validation methods
- Automatic pin generation from certificate data and public keys
- Advanced pin rotation and backup management capabilities
- Integration with certificate transparency logs and monitoring
- Performance-optimized validation with caching and parallelization
- Comprehensive violation detection and response mechanisms
- Support for emergency pin bypass and recovery procedures
- Flexible pinning policies for different security requirements

Security Foundation:
Implements certificate pinning as a critical security mechanism to prevent
man-in-the-middle attacks and rogue certificate issuance by validating
that only specified certificates or public keys are accepted for
secure connections to protected services.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for minimal latency impact with efficient pin validation,
result caching, and streamlined certificate processing to maintain
high-performance secure connections while ensuring pinning compliance.
