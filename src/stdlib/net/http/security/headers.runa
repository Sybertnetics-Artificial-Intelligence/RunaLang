HTTP Security Headers Implementation

This module provides comprehensive HTTP security headers functionality including:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) generation and enforcement
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) configuration
- X-Frame-Options clickjacking protection
- X-Content-Type-Options MIME type sniffing protection
- X-XSS-Protection cross-site scripting filtering
- Referrer-Policy control and privacy protection
- Feature-Policy and Permissions-Policy management
- Public Key Pinning (HPKP) configuration
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers
- Security header validation and compliance checking
- Custom security header management and configuration
- Security policy template generation and customization
- Header injection attack prevention and sanitization
- Security header performance optimization
- Compliance reporting and monitoring capabilities

Key Features:
- Comprehensive security header coverage per OWASP guidelines
- Dynamic policy generation based on application requirements
- Security header conflict detection and resolution
- Performance-optimized header processing and caching
- Integration with modern security standards and specifications
- Customizable security policies for different environments
- Automated security header testing and validation
- Support for legacy browser compatibility considerations

Security Foundation:
Implements industry-standard HTTP security headers to protect against
common web vulnerabilities including XSS, clickjacking, MIME confusion,
and protocol downgrade attacks. Provides comprehensive policy management
for modern web security requirements.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for minimal overhead with efficient header processing,
policy caching, and streamlined header generation to maintain
high-performance web applications while ensuring security compliance.
