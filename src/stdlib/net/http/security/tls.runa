Security Foundation:
Implements industry-standard TLS/SSL protocols with focus on security
best practices, modern cryptographic algorithms, and protection against
known vulnerabilities. Provides comprehensive certificate management
and validation capabilities for secure HTTP communications.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-throughput scenarios with efficient session management,
cipher suite optimization, and hardware acceleration support where available.
Includes connection pooling and session reuse for improved performance.
