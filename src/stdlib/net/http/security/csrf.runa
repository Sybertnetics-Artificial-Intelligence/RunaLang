CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection Implementation

This module provides comprehensive CSRF protection functionality including:
- CSRF token generation and validation mechanisms
- Synchronizer token pattern implementation
- Double submit cookie pattern support
- SameSite cookie attribute configuration for CSRF protection
- CSRF token lifecycle management and rotation
- Request origin and referrer validation
- Custom header verification for AJAX requests
- CSRF protection for REST APIs and web applications
- Token storage and retrieval from various sources
- CSRF attack detection and prevention logging
- Integration with session management systems
- Performance-optimized token validation
- CSRF protection bypass detection and reporting
- Configurable protection levels and exemptions

Key Features:
- Multiple CSRF protection patterns and strategies
- Automatic token injection into forms and AJAX requests
- Configurable token expiration and rotation policies
- Integration with authentication and session systems
- Support for both stateful and stateless CSRF protection
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
- Protection against various CSRF attack vectors
- Performance optimization for high-traffic applications

Security Foundation:
Implements industry-standard CSRF protection mechanisms to prevent
cross-site request forgery attacks by validating request authenticity
through tokens, headers, and origin verification. Provides multiple
layers of protection suitable for different application architectures.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for minimal overhead with efficient token generation,
validation caching, and streamlined request processing to maintain
high-performance web applications while ensuring security compliance.
