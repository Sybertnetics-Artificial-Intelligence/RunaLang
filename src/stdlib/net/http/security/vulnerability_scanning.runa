HTTP Security Vulnerability Scanning Implementation

This module provides comprehensive HTTP security vulnerability scanning functionality including:
- Automated vulnerability detection and assessment capabilities
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanning and validation
- HTTP header security analysis and recommendations
- SSL/TLS configuration assessment and certificate validation
- Web application firewall bypass detection and testing
- Authentication and authorization vulnerability scanning
- Input validation and injection attack vector analysis
- Session management security assessment and testing
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability detection
- SQL injection and NoSQL injection vulnerability scanning
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability assessment
- Directory traversal and path manipulation vulnerability detection
- File upload security vulnerability analysis
- API security assessment and endpoint vulnerability scanning
- Performance-optimized scanning with configurable intensity levels

Key Features:
- Comprehensive vulnerability database with regular updates
- Configurable scanning profiles for different security requirements
- Integration with popular vulnerability databases (CVE, CWE, OWASP)
- Automated report generation with remediation recommendations
- False positive reduction through advanced detection algorithms
- Support for authenticated and unauthenticated scanning modes
- Parallel scanning capabilities for improved performance
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security assessment

Security Foundation:
Implements industry-standard vulnerability detection techniques
and security assessment methodologies to identify and classify
security weaknesses in HTTP-based applications and services,
providing comprehensive coverage of common attack vectors.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient scanning with minimal impact on target
systems through intelligent request throttling, parallel processing,
and configurable scanning intensity to balance thoroughness with speed.
