Content Security Policy (CSP) Management Implementation

This module provides comprehensive Content Security Policy functionality including:
- CSP policy generation and management for web applications
- Directive-based security policy configuration and validation
- CSP violation reporting and analysis capabilities
- Dynamic policy adjustment based on application requirements
- Nonce and hash-based policy implementation for inline content
- CSP policy testing and compliance validation
- Multi-environment policy management and deployment
- CSP policy optimization for performance and security balance
- Integration with modern web frameworks and build systems
- Automated policy generation from application analysis
- CSP policy migration and versioning support
- Browser compatibility management and graceful degradation
- Policy inheritance and composition for complex applications
- Real-time policy updates and A/B testing capabilities
- Comprehensive CSP reporting and monitoring infrastructure

Key Features:
- Complete CSP Level 3 specification implementation
- Automatic policy generation from static and dynamic analysis
- Sophisticated violation reporting and trend analysis
- Performance-optimized policy evaluation and enforcement
- Support for all CSP directives and their variations
- Integration with security headers and XSS prevention systems
- Flexible policy composition and inheritance mechanisms
- Advanced testing and validation tools for policy effectiveness

Security Foundation:
Implements Content Security Policy as the primary defense mechanism
against code injection attacks including XSS, data injection, and
clickjacking by controlling resource loading and execution permissions
through comprehensive policy definition and enforcement.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for minimal overhead with efficient policy parsing,
caching mechanisms, and streamlined violation reporting to ensure
high-performance web applications while maintaining strict security.
