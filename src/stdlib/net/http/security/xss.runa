XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Prevention Implementation

This module provides comprehensive XSS prevention functionality including:
- Input validation and sanitization for XSS prevention
- Output encoding for different contexts (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL)
- Content Security Policy (CSP) integration for XSS mitigation
- HTML sanitization with whitelist-based filtering
- JavaScript code analysis and injection prevention
- DOM-based XSS detection and prevention mechanisms
- Reflected XSS protection and parameter validation
- Stored XSS prevention through data sanitization
- Context-aware output encoding and escaping
- XSS attack pattern recognition and blocking
- Safe HTML rendering with controlled element whitelisting
- Template injection prevention and secure rendering
- Rich text editor security and sanitization
- File upload XSS prevention and validation
- Performance-optimized sanitization routines

Key Features:
- Multi-layered XSS protection with defense in depth
- Context-aware encoding for HTML, JS, CSS, and URL contexts
- Configurable sanitization policies for different content types
- Integration with modern web frameworks and templating engines
- Performance-optimized sanitization with minimal overhead
- Comprehensive XSS attack vector coverage and protection
- Safe HTML parsing and DOM manipulation utilities
- Advanced pattern matching for sophisticated XSS detection

Security Foundation:
Implements industry-standard XSS prevention techniques including
input validation, output encoding, and content filtering to protect
against all major categories of cross-site scripting attacks while
maintaining application functionality and performance.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-throughput applications with efficient parsing,
caching of sanitization results, and streamlined validation routines
to minimize performance impact while ensuring comprehensive protection.
