HTTP Status Code Definitions and Processing

This module provides comprehensive support for HTTP status codes as defined
in RFC 9110 and related specifications. Includes all standard status codes,
categories, reason phrases, and semantic information for proper HTTP
response handling and error processing.

Key Features:
- Complete HTTP status code definitions (1xx-5xx ranges)
- Standard reason phrases and descriptions
- Status code categorization and classification
- Semantic meaning and usage guidelines for each code
- Custom status code support and validation
- Status code compatibility across HTTP versions
- Response requirements and constraints per status code
- Error handling patterns and best practices
- Status code security implications analysis
- Redirection handling and location requirements
- Client and server error differentiation
- Status code selection and recommendation logic

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9110 (HTTP Semantics) status code definitions with extensions
from various HTTP-related RFCs. Implements complete status code registry
with proper semantic constraints and usage guidelines for HTTP compliance.

Applications:
Critical for HTTP servers, clients, and middleware requiring proper status
code handling, error reporting, and response generation. Essential for
REST APIs, web applications, and HTTP protocol implementations.
