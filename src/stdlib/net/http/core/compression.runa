HTTP Content Encoding and Compression

This module provides comprehensive HTTP content encoding and compression
support including gzip, deflate, brotli, and custom compression schemes.
Handles content negotiation, compression selection, and transparent
compression/decompression for improved bandwidth efficiency.

Key Features:
- Complete HTTP content encoding support (gzip, deflate, brotli)
- Content negotiation via Accept-Encoding header
- Compression quality and level configuration
- Streaming compression and decompression
- Content type based compression decisions
- Compression ratio analysis and optimization
- Multiple compression algorithm support
- Content integrity verification after compression
- Compression cache integration and management
- Adaptive compression based on client capabilities
- Custom compression algorithm registration
- Compression performance metrics and monitoring

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9110 (HTTP Semantics) content encoding specifications with
support for modern compression algorithms. Implements proper content
negotiation and encoding selection for optimal performance and compatibility.

Applications:
Essential for web servers, CDNs, proxies, and clients requiring bandwidth
optimization and performance improvement. Critical for modern web applications
with large payloads, API responses, and multimedia content delivery.
