HTTP Caching Implementation and Cache Control

This module provides comprehensive HTTP caching support implementing
RFC 9111 (HTTP Caching) with cache control directives, validation
mechanisms, and storage policies. Handles both client-side and 
server-side caching with proper freshness calculations and revalidation.

Key Features:
- Complete HTTP cache control directive processing
- Cache freshness calculation and validation
- Conditional request generation and validation
- ETag and Last-Modified validation support
- Cache storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Cache invalidation and purging operations
- Vary header processing for content negotiation
- Private vs public cache handling
- Cache size management and eviction policies
- Stale response handling and revalidation
- Cache performance metrics and statistics
- Multi-level cache hierarchy support

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9111 (HTTP Caching) with support for modern caching patterns
including CDN integration, edge caching, and browser cache management.
Implements proper cache semantics for performance and consistency.

Applications:
Critical for web performance optimization in browsers, CDNs, reverse
proxies, and web applications. Essential for reducing bandwidth usage,
improving response times, and scaling web services efficiently.
