HTTP Message Processing and Structure

This module provides comprehensive HTTP message parsing, construction, and
manipulation for both request and response messages. Implements RFC 9110
HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 message semantics with support for headers, body
processing, and various content encodings.

Key Features:
- HTTP request message construction and parsing
- HTTP response message construction and parsing  
- Header field processing and validation
- Message body handling (text, binary, multipart)
- Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding support
- Message validation and compliance checking
- Streaming message processing for large payloads
- HTTP version negotiation and compatibility
- Message serialization and deserialization
- Memory-efficient message buffering

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9110 (HTTP Semantics), RFC 9112 (HTTP/1.1), and RFC 9113
(HTTP/2) specifications. Implements proper message framing, header parsing,
and body processing with full compliance to HTTP standards.

Applications:
Essential for HTTP clients, servers, proxies, and any application requiring
HTTP message processing. Supports web services, REST APIs, and modern web
applications with various content types and encoding methods.
