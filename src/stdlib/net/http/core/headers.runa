HTTP Header Processing and Manipulation

This module provides comprehensive HTTP header parsing, validation, and
manipulation capabilities. Handles all standard headers defined in HTTP
specifications, supports header field semantics, value parsing, and
compliance checking for proper HTTP communication.

Key Features:
- Complete HTTP header parsing and serialization
- Header field validation and format checking
- Multi-value header handling and list processing
- Header name normalization and case-insensitive operations
- Standard header definitions and semantic validation
- Custom header support with validation
- Header compression and encoding support
- Security header analysis and enforcement
- Cache-related header processing
- Authentication and authorization header handling
- Content negotiation header processing
- CORS and security policy header management

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9110 (HTTP Semantics), RFC 9111 (HTTP Caching), and various
header-specific RFCs. Implements proper header field syntax, semantics,
and processing rules with full HTTP specification compliance.

Applications:
Essential for all HTTP implementations including clients, servers, proxies,
and middleware. Critical for web security, content negotiation, caching,
authentication, and modern web application features.
