HTTP Cookie Management and Processing

This module provides comprehensive HTTP cookie support including parsing,
validation, generation, and security management. Implements RFC 6265 
cookie specifications with modern security extensions for SameSite,
Secure, HttpOnly, and other cookie attributes.

Key Features:
- Complete HTTP cookie parsing and serialization
- Cookie attribute validation and processing
- Secure cookie generation and management
- Cookie jar implementation for client-side storage
- Cookie security analysis and enforcement
- SameSite, Secure, HttpOnly attribute handling
- Cookie expiration and lifetime management
- Domain and path scope validation
- Cookie signing and integrity verification
- Session cookie vs persistent cookie handling
- Cookie size and count limits enforcement
- Cross-site cookie security policies

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 6265 (HTTP State Management) with modern security extensions
including SameSite attribute (RFC 6265bis), secure cookie best practices,
and privacy-preserving cookie policies for modern web security.

Applications:
Essential for web applications, HTTP clients, servers, and frameworks
requiring session management, user tracking, authentication tokens,
and stateful HTTP communication with proper security controls.
