HTTP Client Session Management and Connection Pooling

This module provides comprehensive HTTP client session management including
connection pooling, keep-alive connections, session persistence, and
connection lifecycle management for efficient HTTP client operations.

Key Features:
- HTTP connection pooling and reuse
- Keep-alive connection management
- Session state persistence and restoration
- Connection lifecycle and health monitoring
- Concurrent connection limits and throttling
- Connection timeout and idle management
- SSL/TLS session resumption support
- HTTP/2 connection multiplexing
- Connection metrics and diagnostics
- Automatic connection recovery and failover
- Custom connection factory and configuration
- Connection pool optimization and tuning

Technical Foundation:
Built on modern HTTP connection management patterns with support for
HTTP/1.1 persistent connections, HTTP/2 multiplexing, and HTTP/3 QUIC
streams. Implements efficient resource utilization and connection reuse.

Applications:
Essential for high-performance HTTP clients, web scrapers, API clients,
and applications requiring efficient connection management and resource
optimization for large-scale HTTP communication.
