HTTP Client Redirect Handling and Location Following

This module provides comprehensive HTTP redirect handling for clients
including automatic redirect following, redirect loop detection, and
proper handling of different redirect status codes with method preservation
and security considerations.

Key Features:
- Automatic redirect following with configurable limits
- Redirect loop detection and prevention
- Proper handling of all redirect status codes (3xx)
- Method preservation for 307/308 redirects
- Security validation for redirect targets
- Redirect history tracking and analysis
- Custom redirect policy configuration
- Cross-origin redirect handling
- HTTPS to HTTP redirect security controls
- Relative URL resolution for redirect locations
- Redirect performance metrics and monitoring
- Custom redirect handlers and interceptors

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 9110 redirect semantics with proper handling of permanent
and temporary redirects, method preservation rules, and security
considerations for safe redirect following in modern web environments.

Applications:
Essential for web clients, crawlers, API clients, and applications
requiring robust redirect handling with security controls and
performance optimization for complex redirect scenarios.
