HTTP Client Timeout Management and Cancellation

This module provides comprehensive timeout management for HTTP clients
including connection timeouts, read/write timeouts, request timeouts,
and advanced cancellation mechanisms for reliable and responsive
HTTP communication with proper resource management.

Key Features:
- Comprehensive timeout configuration and management
- Connection establishment timeout control
- Read and write operation timeout handling
- Total request timeout with deadline management
- Cancellation token and context-based cancellation
- Timeout escalation and adaptive timeout strategies
- Timeout inheritance and scoping
- Graceful timeout handling with cleanup
- Timeout metrics and monitoring
- Custom timeout handlers and callbacks
- Timeout-aware retry logic integration
- Network condition adaptive timeouts

Technical Foundation:
Implements robust timeout patterns with proper resource cleanup,
cancellation propagation, and deadline management following
modern timeout handling best practices for reliable network programming.

Applications:
Critical for production HTTP clients requiring predictable response
times, resource management, and graceful degradation under various
network conditions and service availability scenarios.
