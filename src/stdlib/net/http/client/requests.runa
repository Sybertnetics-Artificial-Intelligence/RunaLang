HTTP Client Request Creation and Sending

This module provides comprehensive HTTP client request functionality
including request building, sending, and response handling. Supports
all HTTP methods, custom headers, request bodies, and various content
types for modern web client applications and API integrations.

Key Features:
- HTTP request construction and validation
- All standard and custom HTTP methods support
- Request header management and validation
- Request body handling (text, binary, multipart, JSON)
- URL construction and parameter encoding
- Request timeout and cancellation support
- Request interceptors and middleware chains
- Request retry logic with exponential backoff
- Request metrics and performance monitoring
- Connection reuse and keep-alive management
- Request streaming for large payloads
- Custom user agent and client identification

Technical Foundation:
Built on HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 specifications with modern
client patterns. Implements proper request lifecycle management,
connection handling, and error recovery for reliable HTTP communication.

Applications:
Essential for web clients, API consumers, web scrapers, testing tools,
and any application requiring HTTP communication. Supports REST APIs,
GraphQL, webhooks, and modern web service integration patterns.
