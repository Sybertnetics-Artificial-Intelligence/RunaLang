HTTP Client Retry Logic and Exponential Backoff

This module provides comprehensive HTTP request retry functionality with
intelligent retry logic, exponential backoff, jitter, and configurable
retry policies for resilient HTTP communication in unreliable network
conditions and with unreliable services.

Key Features:
- Configurable retry policies with exponential backoff
- Intelligent retry condition detection
- Jitter implementation to prevent thundering herd
- Circuit breaker pattern integration
- Per-request and global retry configuration  
- Retry budget and rate limiting
- Idempotency key generation and validation
- Retry metrics and success rate tracking
- Custom retry conditions and strategies
- Timeout escalation on retries
- Retry history and audit logging
- Adaptive retry strategies based on response patterns

Technical Foundation:
Implements industry best practices for retry logic including exponential
backoff with jitter, circuit breaker patterns, and adaptive retry
strategies based on HTTP semantics and error response analysis.

Applications:
Essential for production HTTP clients requiring reliability and resilience,
API integrations, microservice communication, and any system needing
robust error recovery and fault tolerance in distributed environments.
