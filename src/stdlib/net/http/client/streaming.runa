HTTP Client Streaming Requests and Responses

This module provides comprehensive HTTP streaming support for clients
including streaming request uploads, streaming response processing,
chunked transfer encoding, and real-time data handling for efficient
processing of large payloads and continuous data streams.

Key Features:
- Streaming request body upload with chunked encoding
- Streaming response processing with backpressure
- WebSocket-style streaming over HTTP
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) client support
- Large file upload with progress tracking
- Real-time response processing and callbacks
- Stream flow control and buffering
- Stream cancellation and cleanup
- Memory-efficient streaming with bounded buffers
- Stream compression and decompression
- Multiplexed streaming for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
- Stream error handling and recovery

Technical Foundation:
Built on HTTP/1.1 chunked transfer encoding, HTTP/2 streams, and
modern streaming patterns with proper flow control, backpressure
handling, and memory management for efficient large data processing.

Applications:
Essential for file uploads, media streaming, real-time APIs, data
synchronization, log streaming, and any application requiring
efficient processing of large or continuous data streams over HTTP.
