HTTP Client Authentication and Authorization

This module provides comprehensive HTTP authentication support for clients
including Basic, Digest, Bearer token, OAuth, and custom authentication
schemes. Handles credential management, token refresh, and authentication
flow automation for secure HTTP communication.

Key Features:
- Complete HTTP authentication scheme support
- Basic Authentication with credential encoding
- Digest Authentication with challenge-response handling
- Bearer token authentication for APIs and OAuth
- OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0 flow implementation
- JWT token handling and validation
- API key authentication methods
- Custom authentication scheme support
- Credential storage and management
- Automatic token refresh and renewal
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Authentication middleware and interceptors

Technical Foundation:
Based on RFC 7617 (Basic), RFC 7616 (Digest), RFC 6750 (Bearer Token),
and OAuth specifications. Implements secure credential handling and
proper authentication flows for modern web security patterns.

Applications:
Essential for API clients, web applications, service integrations,
and any system requiring authenticated HTTP communication with
secure credential management and token lifecycle handling.
