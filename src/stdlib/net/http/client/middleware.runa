HTTP Client Middleware and Request/Response Interceptors

This module provides comprehensive middleware and interceptor functionality
for HTTP clients including request/response transformation, logging,
metrics collection, authentication, caching, and custom processing
pipelines for flexible and extensible HTTP client behavior.

Key Features:
- Request and response interceptor pipelines
- Middleware chain management and ordering
- Built-in common middleware (logging, metrics, auth, caching)
- Custom middleware development framework
- Conditional middleware execution
- Middleware error handling and fallback
- Asynchronous middleware support
- Middleware composition and reuse
- Request/response transformation utilities
- Middleware performance monitoring
- Middleware configuration and parameterization
- Thread-safe middleware execution

Technical Foundation:
Implements interceptor and middleware patterns with proper chain-of-responsibility
execution, error propagation, and resource management for maintainable
and extensible HTTP client architectures.

Applications:
Essential for enterprise HTTP clients requiring cross-cutting concerns
like logging, metrics, authentication, caching, and custom business logic
processing across all HTTP requests and responses.
