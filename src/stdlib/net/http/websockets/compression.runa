WebSocket Per-Message Compression Implementation

This module provides comprehensive WebSocket compression functionality including:
- Per-message deflate compression as defined in RFC 7692
- Compression context management and sliding window handling
- Dynamic compression ratio optimization based on content
- Server and client-side compression negotiation
- Compression parameter configuration and tuning
- Memory management for compression contexts and buffers
- Performance optimization for high-throughput scenarios
- Error handling and fallback for compression failures
- Integration with WebSocket frame and message processing
- Adaptive compression based on message characteristics
- Dictionary-based compression for repeated patterns
- Compression statistics and performance monitoring
- Resource limits and protection against compression bombs
- Streaming compression for large messages

Key Features:
- RFC 7692 compliant per-message deflate implementation
- Negotiable compression parameters during WebSocket handshake
- Context takeover management for stateful compression
- Window size configuration for memory/compression tradeoffs
- Automatic compression enablement based on message size
- Integration with WebSocket extension mechanism
- Performance-optimized compression routines
- Memory-bounded compression operations

Protocol Foundation:
Implements the "permessage-deflate" WebSocket extension as specified
in RFC 7692, providing transparent message compression that reduces
bandwidth usage while maintaining protocol compatibility and providing
configuration options for various deployment scenarios.

Performance Considerations:
Includes optimizations for minimizing CPU overhead, memory usage,
and latency impact of compression operations. Supports adaptive
algorithms that balance compression ratio against processing cost
based on message patterns and system load.
