WebSocket Message Processing Implementation

This module provides comprehensive WebSocket message handling functionality including:
- High-level message abstraction over frame processing
- Text and binary message composition and decomposition
- Message queuing and prioritization systems
- Message buffering and flow control mechanisms
- Large message streaming and chunking capabilities
- Message validation and encoding verification
- Broadcast and multicast message distribution
- Message acknowledgment and delivery confirmation
- Message compression and decompression integration
- Message filtering and transformation pipelines
- Message routing and addressing mechanisms
- Performance optimization for message throughput
- Memory management for message buffers
- Error handling and message recovery procedures

Key Features:
- Automatic message assembly from WebSocket frames
- Support for both text (UTF-8) and binary message types
- Message size limits and memory protection
- Queue-based message delivery with backpressure handling
- Message batching for performance optimization
- Integration with compression extensions
- Message metadata tracking and correlation
- Streaming support for large message payloads

Protocol Foundation:
Built on top of the WebSocket frame layer to provide message-level
abstractions that handle fragmentation, reassembly, and proper message
boundary detection. Supports both complete and streaming message processing
patterns for different application requirements.

Performance Considerations:
Includes optimizations for high-throughput messaging scenarios such as
message pooling, zero-copy operations where possible, and efficient
buffer management to minimize garbage collection pressure.
