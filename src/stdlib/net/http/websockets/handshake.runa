WebSocket Protocol Handshake Implementation

This module provides comprehensive WebSocket handshake functionality including:
- HTTP to WebSocket upgrade negotiation
- Sec-WebSocket-Key generation and validation  
- Subprotocol negotiation and selection
- Extension negotiation and configuration
- Origin validation and security checks
- Custom header handling during handshake
- Connection upgrade response generation
- Client and server-side handshake logic
- Error handling for invalid handshakes
- Compliance with RFC 6455 specifications
- Support for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 upgrades
- Authentication integration during handshake
- Rate limiting and connection management
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) support

Key Features:
- Automatic Sec-WebSocket-Accept header generation from client key
- Configurable subprotocol selection algorithms
- Extension parameter parsing and validation  
- Origin policy enforcement with configurable rules
- Custom authentication hooks during upgrade process
- Connection state management during handshake phase
- Comprehensive error reporting for handshake failures
- Performance optimizations for high-throughput scenarios

Protocol Foundation:
Implements the complete WebSocket opening handshake as defined in RFC 6455,
including proper HTTP header parsing, cryptographic key handling, and
protocol upgrade mechanics. Provides both client-initiated and server-side
handshake processing with full compliance to the WebSocket specification.

Security Considerations:
Includes origin validation, authentication integration, rate limiting,
and protection against common WebSocket handshake vulnerabilities such as
cross-site WebSocket hijacking and protocol downgrade attacks.
