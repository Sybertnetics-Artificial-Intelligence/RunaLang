WebSocket Subprotocols Implementation

This module provides comprehensive WebSocket subprotocol functionality including:
- Subprotocol negotiation during WebSocket handshake process
- Subprotocol registration and discovery mechanisms
- Application-layer protocol implementation and management
- Subprotocol-specific message formatting and parsing
- Multiple subprotocol support and routing capabilities
- Custom subprotocol development framework and APIs
- Subprotocol versioning and compatibility management
- Protocol-specific validation and error handling
- Subprotocol metadata management and documentation
- Performance optimization for subprotocol operations
- Integration with WebSocket message and frame processing
- Subprotocol security validation and sandboxing
- Dynamic subprotocol loading and switching capabilities
- Protocol bridging and translation services

Key Features:
- RFC 6455 compliant subprotocol negotiation
- Pluggable architecture for custom subprotocol implementations
- Automatic protocol selection based on client preferences
- Support for standard subprotocols (STOMP, MQTT, etc.)
- Protocol-specific message routing and handling
- Subprotocol state management and lifecycle control
- Integration with authentication and authorization systems
- Performance monitoring and optimization for protocol operations

Protocol Foundation:
Implements the WebSocket subprotocol negotiation mechanism as defined
in RFC 6455, providing a framework for implementing application-layer
protocols over WebSocket connections with proper protocol selection
and message handling capabilities.

Architecture Considerations:
Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing easy
addition of new subprotocols while maintaining clear separation of
concerns and providing efficient message routing and processing
capabilities for multiple concurrent subprotocols.
