WebSocket Ping-Pong Keepalive Implementation

This module provides comprehensive WebSocket ping-pong keepalive functionality including:
- Automatic ping frame generation and transmission scheduling
- Pong frame response handling and validation
- Connection liveness detection and monitoring
- Heartbeat interval configuration and management
- Timeout detection for unresponsive connections
- Connection health scoring and reporting
- Network quality estimation through round-trip timing
- Adaptive ping intervals based on network conditions
- Connection failure detection and recovery
- Statistics collection for connection monitoring
- Integration with connection management systems
- Performance optimization for high-connection scenarios
- Customizable ping payload for application-specific needs
- Graceful degradation for network instability

Key Features:
- RFC 6455 compliant ping-pong frame handling
- Configurable ping intervals and timeout thresholds
- Automatic pong response generation for received pings
- Round-trip time measurement and network quality metrics
- Connection state tracking through keepalive status
- Integration with WebSocket connection lifecycle management
- Support for custom ping payloads and application data
- Efficient timer management for multiple connections

Protocol Foundation:
Implements WebSocket ping and pong control frames as defined in RFC 6455
for connection keepalive, providing reliable detection of connection
failures and network issues. Supports both client and server-side
keepalive operations with configurable parameters.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for managing keepalive operations across thousands of concurrent
connections with minimal CPU and memory overhead. Includes adaptive algorithms
for adjusting ping frequency based on observed network characteristics.
