WebSocket Extensions Management Implementation

This module provides comprehensive WebSocket extensions management functionality including:
- Extension negotiation during WebSocket handshake process
- Extension registration and discovery mechanisms
- Extension parameter parsing and validation
- Extension lifecycle management and state tracking
- Multiple extension coordination and interaction handling
- Extension-specific frame processing and transformation
- Extension capability advertisement and matching
- Custom extension development support and APIs
- Extension conflict detection and resolution
- Performance monitoring for extension operations
- Extension metadata management and documentation
- Security validation for extension implementations
- Extension versioning and compatibility management
- Dynamic extension loading and unloading capabilities

Key Features:
- RFC 6455 compliant extension negotiation framework
- Pluggable architecture for custom extension development
- Automatic conflict resolution for incompatible extensions
- Performance-optimized extension processing pipelines
- Comprehensive extension parameter validation
- Extension dependency management and ordering
- Integration with WebSocket frame and message processing
- Support for standard extensions (compression, multiplexing, etc.)

Protocol Foundation:
Implements the WebSocket extension negotiation mechanism as defined
in RFC 6455, providing a framework for extending WebSocket protocol
functionality through standardized extension headers and parameter
negotiation during the connection handshake phase.

Architecture Considerations:
Designed with a modular plugin architecture that allows for easy
addition of new extensions while maintaining protocol compliance
and providing mechanisms for extension interaction management
and performance optimization.
