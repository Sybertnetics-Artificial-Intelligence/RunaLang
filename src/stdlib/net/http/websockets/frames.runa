WebSocket Frame Processing Implementation

This module provides comprehensive WebSocket frame handling functionality including:
- Frame structure parsing and construction per RFC 6455
- Payload masking and unmasking for client/server frames
- Frame fragmentation and reassembly for large messages
- Control frame handling (close, ping, pong frames)
- Binary and text frame data processing
- Frame validation and protocol compliance checking
- Payload length encoding for small, medium, and large frames
- Masking key generation and application
- Frame header manipulation and optimization
- Stream processing for continuous frame handling
- Error detection and recovery for malformed frames
- Performance optimizations for high-throughput scenarios
- Memory management for large frame payloads
- Compression integration with frame processing

Key Features:
- Complete RFC 6455 frame format implementation
- Automatic masking/unmasking based on client/server role
- Fragmented message reassembly with buffering management
- Control frame priority handling and immediate processing
- Payload size validation and memory protection
- Streaming frame parsing for network efficiency
- Frame sequence validation and ordering
- Integration with WebSocket extension processing

Protocol Foundation:
Implements the complete WebSocket frame structure including opcode handling,
payload length encoding, masking mechanics, and frame boundary detection.
Provides both parsing and construction capabilities for all frame types
defined in the WebSocket specification.

Security Considerations:
Includes payload size limits, masking validation, control frame rate limiting,
and protection against frame-based attacks such as resource exhaustion
and protocol confusion vulnerabilities.
