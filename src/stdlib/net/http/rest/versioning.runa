REST API Versioning Implementation

This module provides comprehensive API versioning functionality including:
- Multiple versioning strategies (URL, header, query parameter, content negotiation)
- Semantic versioning support with major, minor, and patch levels
- Version compatibility matrix and migration path management
- Backward compatibility maintenance and deprecation handling
- Version-specific resource schemas and validation rules
- API evolution tracking and change impact analysis
- Version negotiation and client capability detection
- Legacy version support with graceful degradation
- Version-aware routing and endpoint resolution
- Migration utilities and version upgrade assistance
- Version documentation generation and maintenance
- API lifecycle management and version retirement
- Performance optimization for multi-version support
- Version analytics and usage tracking
- Automated version testing and compatibility validation

Key Features:
- Support for all major API versioning strategies and patterns
- Intelligent version negotiation based on client capabilities
- Comprehensive backward compatibility and migration support
- Version-specific schema validation and transformation
- Performance-optimized multi-version request handling
- Detailed version analytics and deprecation management
- Integration with API documentation and developer tools
- Automated testing across multiple API versions

Architecture Foundation:
Built on flexible version management architecture that supports
multiple versioning strategies simultaneously while maintaining
clean separation between version-specific logic and core
business functionality for maintainable API evolution.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for minimal overhead in multi-version environments
through efficient version resolution, schema caching, and
streamlined request routing to ensure consistent performance
across all supported API versions.
