REST API Filtering Implementation

This module provides comprehensive filtering functionality including:
- Query parameter-based filtering with multiple operators
- Complex filtering expressions and logical operators
- Field-based filtering with type-aware comparisons
- Range filtering for numeric, date, and time values
- Text filtering with pattern matching and full-text search
- Collection filtering with set operations and membership tests
- Custom filter operators and extension mechanisms
- Filter validation and security sanitization
- Performance-optimized filter query generation
- Filter composition and combination strategies
- Saved filters and filter templates management
- Filter analytics and usage tracking
- Integration with pagination and sorting systems
- Filter caching and result optimization
- Multi-level filtering with nested resource support

Key Features:
- Comprehensive filter operator support (equals, greater than, contains, etc.)
- Complex boolean logic with AND, OR, NOT operations
- Type-safe filtering with automatic data type conversion
- Performance optimization through query analysis and indexing
- Security features including injection prevention and sanitization
- Flexible filter syntax supporting multiple query formats
- Integration with search engines and full-text indexing
- Caching strategies for frequently used filter combinations

Architecture Foundation:
Built on extensible filtering framework that supports multiple
query syntaxes and backends while providing consistent filtering
semantics and efficient query execution across different
data sources and storage systems.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-performance filtering with intelligent
query optimization, index utilization, and result caching
to ensure fast filter execution even for complex filtering
expressions on large datasets.
