REST API Resource Management Implementation

This module provides comprehensive REST resource management functionality including:
- RESTful resource modeling and CRUD operations implementation
- Resource identification and URI pattern management
- HTTP method routing and resource action mapping
- Resource state management and lifecycle operations
- Nested resource relationships and hierarchical structures
- Resource validation and constraint enforcement
- Resource serialization and representation management
- Resource caching and performance optimization
- Resource versioning and backwards compatibility
- Resource access control and permission management
- Resource metadata and schema management
- Bulk resource operations and batch processing
- Resource query and filtering capabilities
- Resource pagination and result set management
- Integration with database and storage systems

Key Features:
- Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation
- RESTful URI design patterns and resource identification
- HTTP method semantics and proper response code handling
- Resource relationship modeling and nested resource support
- Flexible resource representation and content negotiation
- Resource state validation and business rule enforcement
- Performance optimization with caching and lazy loading
- Comprehensive error handling and validation feedback

Architecture Foundation:
Implements REST architectural principles with proper resource abstraction,
stateless interactions, and uniform interface design to provide a robust
foundation for building RESTful APIs that are scalable, maintainable,
and compliant with REST design principles.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-throughput API operations with efficient resource
loading, result caching, and minimal database queries through intelligent
lazy loading and batch operation support.
