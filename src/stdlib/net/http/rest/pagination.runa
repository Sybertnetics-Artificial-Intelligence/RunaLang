REST API Pagination Implementation

This module provides comprehensive pagination functionality including:
- Multiple pagination strategies (offset, cursor, token-based, page-based)
- Configurable page size limits and optimization
- Navigation link generation (first, last, next, previous)
- Cursor-based pagination for consistent results across changes
- Token-based pagination with secure continuation tokens
- Range-based pagination for efficient data retrieval
- Pagination metadata and result count information
- Deep pagination optimization and performance tuning
- Sort-stable pagination with consistent ordering
- Filtering integration with paginated results
- Caching strategies for paginated data
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Custom pagination handlers and strategies
- Pagination security and access control
- Analytics and usage tracking for pagination patterns

Key Features:
- Support for all major pagination patterns and strategies
- Intelligent pagination strategy selection based on data characteristics
- Secure cursor and token generation with tampering protection
- Performance-optimized pagination with minimal database impact
- Comprehensive navigation and metadata generation
- Integration with filtering, sorting, and search operations
- Configurable pagination policies and limits
- Advanced cursor-based pagination for real-time data

Architecture Foundation:
Built on flexible pagination framework that supports multiple
strategies simultaneously while maintaining consistent API
interface and providing efficient data access patterns for
large dataset navigation and optimal user experience.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for large dataset pagination with minimal memory
footprint, efficient query generation, and intelligent
caching strategies to ensure fast response times regardless
of pagination depth or result set size.
