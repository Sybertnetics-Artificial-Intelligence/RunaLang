REST API Documentation Generation

This module provides comprehensive REST API documentation functionality including:
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification generation and management
- Interactive API documentation with live testing capabilities
- Schema documentation with examples and validation rules
- Endpoint documentation with request/response examples
- Authentication and authorization documentation
- Code generation for client SDKs in multiple languages
- Documentation versioning and change tracking
- API blueprint generation and markdown documentation
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated documentation
- Documentation hosting and deployment management
- Custom documentation themes and branding
- Multi-language documentation support and internationalization
- Documentation analytics and usage tracking
- Automated documentation testing and validation
- Integration with API testing and monitoring tools

Key Features:
- Full OpenAPI 3.0+ specification support with extensions
- Interactive documentation with try-it-now functionality
- Comprehensive schema documentation with validation examples
- Multi-format output (HTML, PDF, Markdown, JSON, YAML)
- Automated documentation generation from code annotations
- Version-aware documentation with migration guides
- Custom documentation plugins and extension system
- Integration with popular documentation platforms and tools

Documentation Foundation:
Built on industry-standard documentation formats and tools,
providing comprehensive API documentation that serves both
human developers and automated systems for complete
API lifecycle documentation and developer experience.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient documentation generation and serving
with intelligent caching, incremental updates, and CDN
integration to ensure fast documentation access and
minimal impact on API performance.
