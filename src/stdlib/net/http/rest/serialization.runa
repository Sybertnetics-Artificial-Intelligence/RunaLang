REST API Serialization Implementation

This module provides comprehensive REST API serialization functionality including:
- JSON, XML, YAML, and custom format serialization support
- Object-to-representation transformation with configurable formatting
- Deserialization with validation and type conversion
- Content negotiation and format selection based on Accept headers
- Schema-driven serialization with field validation and transformation
- Nested object serialization with circular reference handling
- Custom field serializers and deserializers registration
- Performance-optimized serialization with streaming support
- Internationalization and localization support for serialized content
- Error handling and validation feedback during serialization
- Serialization middleware and plugin architecture
- Compression and encoding integration for optimized transfer
- Versioning support for backward-compatible serialization
- Security-aware serialization with sensitive data filtering
- Batch serialization for collection processing efficiency

Key Features:
- Multi-format serialization with pluggable format providers
- Schema-based validation and transformation during serialization
- Content negotiation with client preference handling
- Streaming serialization for large datasets and memory efficiency
- Custom field processors for specialized data transformation
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed validation feedback
- Performance optimization through caching and lazy evaluation
- Security features including sensitive data masking and filtering

Architecture Foundation:
Built on a flexible serialization framework that supports multiple
representation formats while maintaining consistency in API responses
and providing extensible mechanisms for custom serialization logic
and format-specific optimizations.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-throughput serialization with minimal memory overhead,
efficient streaming capabilities, and intelligent caching strategies
to ensure fast response times while maintaining data integrity.
