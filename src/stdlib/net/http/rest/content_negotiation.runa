REST Content Negotiation Implementation

This module provides comprehensive content negotiation functionality including:
- HTTP Accept header parsing and content type selection
- Media type negotiation with quality factors and preferences
- Character encoding negotiation and charset selection
- Language negotiation based on Accept-Language headers
- Content encoding negotiation for compression support
- Custom content negotiation strategies and algorithms
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported content types
- Content variant selection and caching optimization
- Multi-dimensional content negotiation (type, language, encoding)
- Content negotiation result caching for performance
- Integration with serialization and response generation
- Content negotiation middleware and pipeline integration
- Quality factor calculation and preference ordering
- Content negotiation analytics and monitoring
- Configurable negotiation policies and rules

Key Features:
- RFC 7231 compliant content negotiation implementation
- Support for complex Accept headers with quality factors
- Multi-dimensional negotiation across content dimensions
- Intelligent fallback and default content selection
- Performance optimization through negotiation result caching
- Extensible negotiation algorithms and custom strategies
- Integration with REST serialization and response systems
- Comprehensive logging and analytics for negotiation decisions

Protocol Foundation:
Implements HTTP content negotiation as specified in RFC 7231,
providing transparent content variant selection based on client
preferences while maintaining server capabilities and resource
availability constraints for optimal content delivery.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-throughput content negotiation with efficient
header parsing, result caching, and minimal computational overhead
to ensure fast content selection without impacting response times.
