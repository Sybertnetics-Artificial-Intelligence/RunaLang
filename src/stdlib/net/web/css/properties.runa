CSS Property Handling and Computation

This module provides comprehensive CSS property handling and computation functionality including:
- CSS property validation and parsing with complete specification support
- Property value computation and inheritance resolution
- Shorthand property expansion and longhand property combination
- Custom property (CSS variables) resolution and cascading
- Property value type checking and unit conversion
- Computed value calculation for layout and rendering engines
- Property animation and transition value interpolation
- Cross-browser property normalization and vendor prefix handling
- CSS Grid and Flexbox property computation with advanced layout support
- Color property handling with all color space conversions
- Font property resolution and font matching algorithms
- Performance-optimized property processing for style engines

Property Foundation:
CSS properties define the visual and behavioral characteristics of
elements, requiring sophisticated parsing, validation, computation,
and inheritance handling to support the complete CSS specification
while maintaining optimal performance for style engines.

Specification Coverage:
Complete support for CSS2.1, CSS3, CSS4 properties including
Grid, Flexbox, transforms, animations, custom properties, and
emerging specifications with extensible architecture for new properties.
