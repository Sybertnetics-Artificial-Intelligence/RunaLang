CSS Framework Integration and Support

This module provides comprehensive CSS framework integration and support functionality including:
- Bootstrap framework integration with complete component support
- Tailwind CSS integration with utility-first class generation
- Foundation framework support with responsive grid systems
- Bulma CSS framework integration with modern flexbox layouts
- Semantic UI integration with natural language naming conventions
- Material Design CSS framework support with Google's design principles
- Custom framework creation tools and component libraries
- Framework-agnostic utility class generation and management
- CSS-in-JS framework integration (Styled Components, Emotion)
- Framework migration tools and compatibility layers
- Performance optimization for framework-specific patterns
- Theme customization and design system integration across frameworks

Framework Foundation:
CSS frameworks provide pre-built components and utilities that
accelerate development while maintaining design consistency,
requiring sophisticated integration, customization, and optimization
capabilities to support diverse framework architectures and patterns.

Multi-Framework Support:
Universal framework integration architecture supporting popular
CSS frameworks while providing tools for custom framework
development and framework-agnostic utility generation.
