CSS Minification and Optimization

This module provides comprehensive CSS minification and optimization functionality including:
- CSS code minification with whitespace and comment removal
- Property value optimization and shorthand conversion
- Selector optimization and deduplication with specificity preservation
- Color value optimization across different formats (hex, rgb, hsl, named)
- Unit optimization and unnecessary unit removal
- Dead code elimination and unused rule removal
- CSS property merging and consolidation
- Media query optimization and merging
- Vendor prefix optimization and removal of unnecessary prefixes
- Advanced optimization techniques for size reduction
- Source map preservation during minification process
- Performance-optimized minification for large stylesheets and build systems

Minification Foundation:
CSS minification reduces file size and improves loading performance
while preserving functionality through intelligent optimization
techniques that maintain CSS semantics and cascade behavior
while eliminating redundancy and unnecessary content.

Optimization Strategy:
Advanced optimization techniques including structural analysis,
dependency tracking, and semantic preservation ensure maximum
size reduction without affecting visual output or CSS behavior.
