CSS Parsing and AST Generation

This module provides comprehensive CSS parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree generation functionality including:
- Complete CSS3 specification parsing with advanced selector support
- CSS AST generation with full syntax tree representation
- SCSS and LESS preprocessor syntax parsing with variable resolution
- CSS-in-JS parsing and extraction from JavaScript code
- Custom property (CSS variables) parsing and dependency tracking
- At-rule parsing including media queries, keyframes, and imports
- Error recovery and malformed CSS handling with detailed diagnostics
- Source map generation for preprocessed CSS debugging
- Performance-optimized parsing for large stylesheets and build systems
- Streaming CSS parsing for real-time style processing
- Integration with linting and validation systems
- Cross-browser compatibility analysis during parsing

Parser Foundation:
CSS parsing enables sophisticated stylesheet processing, optimization,
and transformation while maintaining complete fidelity to the original
source code structure and providing comprehensive error handling
for real-world CSS content scenarios.

Standards Coverage:
Full support for CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3 specifications, CSS4 selectors,
CSS Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, and emerging CSS features
with extensible architecture for future specification updates.
