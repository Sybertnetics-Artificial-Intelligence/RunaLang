CSS Preprocessor Implementation

This module provides comprehensive CSS preprocessor functionality including:
- SCSS/Sass syntax processing with complete feature support
- LESS preprocessor implementation with mixins and functions
- Stylus-like preprocessor capabilities with flexible syntax
- Variable resolution and scoping with proper inheritance
- Mixin definition and invocation with parameter passing
- Function definition and execution with return values
- Nested rule processing and flattening to standard CSS
- Import and include system with dependency management
- Conditional compilation with @if/@else/@elsif directives
- Loop constructs (@for, @each, @while) with iteration control
- Mathematical operations and color manipulation functions
- Custom preprocessor extensions and plugin architecture
- Source map generation for debugging preprocessed CSS

Preprocessor Foundation:
CSS preprocessors extend CSS with programming constructs that enable
more maintainable and powerful stylesheets through variables, mixins,
functions, and control flow while compiling to standard CSS for
browser consumption with full debugging support.

Language Support:
Complete implementation of SCSS, Sass (indented syntax), LESS,
and Stylus features with extensible architecture for custom
preprocessor languages and syntax extensions.
