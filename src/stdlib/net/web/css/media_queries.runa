Media Query Processing and Evaluation

This module provides comprehensive media query processing and evaluation functionality including:
- CSS media query parsing with complete Media Queries Level 4+ support
- Media feature evaluation and device capability matching
- Responsive design breakpoint management and optimization
- Dynamic media query evaluation for changing device conditions
- Custom media query registration and extension mechanisms
- Media query optimization for performance and bandwidth considerations
- Container query support for component-based responsive design
- Print media query handling with pagination and print-specific features
- Accessibility media query support (prefers-reduced-motion, prefers-color-scheme)
- Integration with CSS parsing and style application systems
- Media query debugging and analysis tools
- Performance-optimized evaluation for real-time responsive updates

Media Query Foundation:
Media queries enable responsive design by allowing styles to be applied
conditionally based on device characteristics, user preferences, and
environmental conditions, requiring sophisticated parsing and evaluation
to support modern responsive web design patterns.

Specification Coverage:
Complete support for Media Queries Level 4, Container Queries,
environment variables, user preference media features, and emerging
responsive design specifications with extensible architecture.
