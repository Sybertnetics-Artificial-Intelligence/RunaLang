CSS Selector Matching and Evaluation

This module provides comprehensive CSS selector matching and evaluation functionality including:
- CSS selector parsing with complete CSS3+ selector support
- Element matching algorithms with optimized performance characteristics
- Specificity calculation and cascade resolution for style application
- Pseudo-class and pseudo-element evaluation with dynamic state support
- Complex selector matching including combinators and relationship selectors
- CSS4 selector features including :has(), :is(), :where(), and :not()
- Performance-optimized matching for large DOM trees and complex stylesheets
- Selector query engines for programmatic element selection
- Cross-browser compatibility handling for selector features
- Integration with CSS parsing and style computation systems
- Custom pseudo-class registration and evaluation mechanisms
- Selector optimization and performance analysis tools

Selector Foundation:
CSS selectors are fundamental to style application and DOM querying,
requiring efficient matching algorithms that handle the full complexity
of CSS selector syntax while maintaining optimal performance for
real-time style computation and element selection operations.

Performance Focus:
All selector operations are optimized for performance with efficient
algorithms, caching strategies, and minimal DOM traversal to support
high-performance style engines and query operations.
