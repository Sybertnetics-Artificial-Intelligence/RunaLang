Single Page Application Framework and Client-Side Architecture

This module provides comprehensive SPA framework implementation including
client-side routing, state management, component systems, and advanced
SPA patterns. Supports modern SPA development with virtual DOM, reactive
programming, and optimized client-server communication for responsive applications.

Key Features:
- Complete SPA framework with client-side routing and navigation
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI components
- State management with centralized stores and reactive updates
- Virtual DOM implementation for efficient rendering
- Client-side templating and data binding systems
- AJAX and WebSocket communication with server APIs
- Browser history management and deep linking support
- Lazy loading and code splitting for performance
- Service worker integration for offline capabilities
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features and manifest management
- Client-side caching and storage management
- Form handling and validation on the client side
- Real-time updates with WebSocket and Server-Sent Events
- Authentication and authorization for client applications
- Internationalization and localization support
- Testing framework for SPA components and logic
- Development tools including hot reload and debugging
- SEO optimization with server-side rendering support
- Bundle optimization and asset management
- Cross-browser compatibility and polyfills
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Error handling and crash reporting
- Accessibility features and ARIA support
- Mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
- Enterprise SPA architecture patterns

Physical Foundation:
Single Page Applications load once and dynamically update content through
JavaScript, using client-side routing for navigation and AJAX for data
exchange. This approach provides desktop-like user experience with smooth
transitions and responsive interactions without full page reloads.

Applications:
Modern web applications, dashboards, admin interfaces, e-commerce platforms,
social media applications, productivity tools, and any web application
requiring rich interactivity and responsive user experience.
