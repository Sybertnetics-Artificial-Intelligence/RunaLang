Authorization Framework and Access Control Management

This module provides comprehensive authorization and access control
capabilities including role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based
access control (ABAC), and advanced permission management. Supports
enterprise-grade authorization with policy engines and fine-grained access control.

Key Features:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with hierarchical roles
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with policy evaluation
- Permission management with granular access control
- Policy engine for complex authorization rules
- Resource-based access control with ownership models
- Dynamic authorization with context-aware decisions
- Access control lists (ACL) for fine-grained permissions
- Organization and tenant-based access control
- API endpoint authorization and method-level security
- Data-level authorization and field-level access control
- Time-based and location-based access restrictions
- Authorization middleware for web frameworks
- Permission inheritance and delegation mechanisms
- Authorization caching for performance optimization
- Audit logging and compliance tracking
- Authorization testing and validation frameworks
- Integration with authentication systems
- Cross-service authorization for microservices
- Authorization policy management and versioning
- Real-time authorization with dynamic updates
- Authorization analytics and reporting
- Security compliance and regulatory support
- Advanced authorization patterns and best practices
- Authorization debugging and development tools
- Enterprise authorization features and scalability

Physical Foundation:
Authorization determines what authenticated users can access and perform
within a system. It evaluates user credentials, roles, permissions, and
contextual information against defined policies to make access decisions
while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

Applications:
Enterprise applications, multi-tenant systems, content management,
e-commerce platforms, healthcare systems, financial services, and any
application requiring sophisticated access control and permission management.
