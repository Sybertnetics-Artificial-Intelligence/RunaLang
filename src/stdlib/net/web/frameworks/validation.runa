Input Validation and Data Sanitization Framework

This module provides comprehensive input validation and sanitization
capabilities including data validation, input sanitization, and security
protection. Supports advanced validation patterns with custom rules,
cross-field validation, and enterprise-grade data integrity assurance.

Key Features:
- Comprehensive input validation with custom rule definitions
- Data sanitization and normalization for security
- Type validation and conversion with strict type checking
- Cross-field validation and conditional validation rules
- Regular expression validation with pattern matching
- Range validation for numeric and date values
- String validation with length and format constraints
- Email, URL, and format-specific validation
- File upload validation with security scanning
- JSON schema validation and structure validation
- Custom validation rule engine and extensibility
- Validation error handling and user-friendly messages
- Batch validation for multiple inputs
- Async validation for external data sources
- Validation caching for performance optimization
- Internationalization support for error messages
- Security-focused validation against common attacks
- Performance optimization and validation profiling
- Validation testing framework and test generation
- Enterprise validation patterns and best practices
- Validation middleware integration
- Real-time validation for interactive forms
- Validation reporting and analytics
- Advanced sanitization with context awareness
- Validation rule composition and inheritance

Physical Foundation:
Input validation ensures data integrity by checking incoming data against
defined rules and constraints before processing. Sanitization cleanses
data of potentially harmful content while preserving legitimate data,
providing defense against injection attacks and data corruption.

Applications:
Web forms, API endpoints, data processing pipelines, user registration
systems, content management, e-commerce platforms, and any system
requiring data validation and security protection against malicious input.
