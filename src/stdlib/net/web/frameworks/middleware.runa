Web Middleware Framework and Request Processing Pipeline

This module provides comprehensive middleware framework implementation
including request/response processing, pipeline management, and advanced
middleware patterns. Supports flexible middleware composition with
dependency injection, error handling, and performance optimization.

Key Features:
- Complete middleware framework with pipeline architecture
- Request and response processing middleware
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Logging and monitoring middleware integration
- Error handling and exception middleware
- CORS and security headers middleware
- Rate limiting and throttling middleware
- Compression and optimization middleware
- Caching middleware with multiple strategies
- Session management middleware
- Content negotiation middleware
- Request validation and sanitization
- Response transformation middleware
- Custom middleware development framework
- Middleware composition and chaining
- Conditional middleware execution
- Middleware performance monitoring
- Middleware testing and debugging tools
- Enterprise middleware patterns
- Middleware configuration management
- Hot-swappable middleware support
- Middleware dependency injection
- Cross-cutting concern implementation
- Middleware error recovery strategies
- Advanced middleware optimization

Physical Foundation:
Middleware operates as a chain of processing components that handle HTTP
requests and responses sequentially. Each middleware can modify requests,
responses, or both, and decide whether to continue processing or terminate
the pipeline, enabling modular cross-cutting functionality.

Applications:
Web applications, API services, microservices, enterprise applications,
and any HTTP-based system requiring modular request/response processing
with cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and caching.
