Web Authentication Framework and Identity Management

This module provides comprehensive web authentication capabilities
including user authentication, session management, and advanced
authentication patterns. Supports multiple authentication methods with
security best practices, OAuth integration, and enterprise identity management.

Key Features:
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with various factor types
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect integration
- JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and management
- Session-based authentication with secure session handling
- Password hashing and security with bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt
- Social login integration (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) implementation and integration
- API key authentication and management
- Certificate-based authentication for enterprise use
- Biometric authentication integration capabilities
- Authentication middleware for web frameworks
- User registration and account verification workflows
- Password reset and account recovery mechanisms
- Authentication rate limiting and brute force protection
- Secure cookie management and CSRF protection
- Authentication auditing and security logging
- Role-based authentication integration
- Authentication testing and security validation
- Cross-platform authentication compatibility
- Authentication performance optimization
- Enterprise authentication patterns
- Authentication debugging and development tools
- Security compliance and standards adherence
- Advanced authentication features and extensions
- Authentication analytics and monitoring

Physical Foundation:
Web authentication verifies user identity through credentials, tokens,
or other authentication factors. The system manages authentication state,
session persistence, and security measures to ensure only authorized
users can access protected resources and functionality.

Applications:
Web applications, APIs, enterprise systems, e-commerce platforms,
content management systems, social platforms, and any system requiring
user authentication and secure access control mechanisms.
