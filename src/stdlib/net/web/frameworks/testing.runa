Physical Foundation:
Web testing validates application functionality, performance, and security
by executing automated test scenarios against different application layers.
Tests simulate user interactions, API calls, and system behaviors to ensure
quality and reliability across various environments and conditions.

Applications:
Web applications, APIs, e-commerce platforms, enterprise systems,
mobile applications, microservices, and any software requiring
comprehensive quality assurance and testing validation.
