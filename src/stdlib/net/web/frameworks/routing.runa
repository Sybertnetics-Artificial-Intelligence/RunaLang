Advanced Routing Framework and URL Management

This module provides comprehensive routing framework implementation
including URL pattern matching, nested routes, and advanced routing
patterns. Supports dynamic routing, route guards, parameter extraction,
and enterprise-grade URL management for complex web applications.

Key Features:
- Advanced URL routing with pattern matching and parameter extraction
- Nested routing with hierarchical route structures
- Dynamic routing with runtime route registration
- Route guards for authentication and authorization
- Parameter validation and type conversion
- Query parameter handling and parsing
- Route caching and performance optimization
- URL generation and reverse routing
- Route versioning and API routing
- Middleware integration with route-specific middleware
- Route-based code splitting and lazy loading
- Internationalization routing with locale support
- SEO-friendly URL structures and canonicalization
- Route debugging and development tools
- Custom route matchers and pattern extensions
- Route conflict resolution and priority handling
- Performance monitoring and route analytics
- Route testing and validation frameworks
- Enterprise routing patterns and best practices
- Route documentation and introspection
- Advanced routing features for microservices
- Route-based access control and permissions
- Dynamic route generation from configuration
- Route optimization and bundle splitting
- Cross-platform routing compatibility

Physical Foundation:
URL routing maps incoming HTTP requests to appropriate handlers based on
URL patterns, HTTP methods, and other criteria. The router parses URLs,
extracts parameters, applies constraints, and determines the correct
handler while supporting complex routing hierarchies and dynamic patterns.

Applications:
Web applications, single-page applications, API services, microservices,
content management systems, and any HTTP-based system requiring flexible
URL routing and request dispatch mechanisms.
