Server-Side Rendering Framework and Optimization

This module provides comprehensive server-side rendering capabilities
including template processing, hydration, and performance optimization.
Supports modern SSR patterns with streaming, caching, and SEO optimization
for enhanced web application performance and search engine visibility.

Key Features:
- Complete server-side rendering framework with template processing
- HTML generation and DOM construction on the server
- Client-side hydration and progressive enhancement
- Streaming SSR for improved perceived performance
- Static site generation (SSG) and pre-rendering capabilities
- SEO optimization with meta tags and structured data
- Performance optimization with caching and compression
- Code splitting and lazy loading integration
- Universal/isomorphic application support
- Server-side data fetching and API integration
- Error handling and fallback rendering strategies
- Development tools with hot module replacement
- Build optimization and bundle analysis
- Progressive Web App (PWA) integration
- Accessibility features and ARIA support
- Internationalization and localization support
- Security features including XSS protection
- Performance monitoring and Core Web Vitals optimization
- Edge computing and CDN integration
- Advanced caching strategies and invalidation
- Serverless deployment optimization
- Component-based SSR architecture
- Template engine integration and abstraction
- Asset optimization and critical resource prioritization
- Advanced SSR patterns and enterprise features

Physical Foundation:
Server-side rendering generates complete HTML on the server before sending
to the client, improving initial page load times, SEO, and providing content
to users with JavaScript disabled. Hydration then adds interactivity by
attaching client-side JavaScript to the server-rendered markup.

Applications:
E-commerce websites, content management systems, marketing sites, blogs,
documentation sites, and any web application requiring optimal SEO,
performance, and user experience with fast initial page loads.
