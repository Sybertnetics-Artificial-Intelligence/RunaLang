RESTful API Framework and Service Architecture

This module provides comprehensive RESTful API framework implementation
including resource management, HTTP method handling, content negotiation,
and advanced REST patterns. Supports enterprise-grade API development with
authentication, versioning, documentation, and performance optimization.

Key Features:
- Complete REST API framework with resource-based architecture
- HTTP method handling (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS)
- Resource routing and URL pattern matching
- Content negotiation with multiple media types (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.)
- Request/response serialization and deserialization
- API versioning strategies (URL, header, query parameter)
- Authentication and authorization for API endpoints
- Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
- API documentation generation and interactive explorers
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support
- HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) implementation
- Input validation and output filtering
- Error handling with standardized error responses
- Caching strategies for API responses
- Compression and encoding support
- Middleware pipeline for request/response processing
- Bulk operations and batch processing
- Pagination and filtering for large datasets
- API monitoring and analytics
- Testing framework for REST APIs
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification generation
- Service discovery and registry integration
- Microservices communication patterns
- Enterprise security features
- Performance optimization and scaling

Physical Foundation:
REST architecture uses HTTP protocols and standard methods to create
stateless, cacheable, and scalable web services. Resources are identified
by URLs, and operations are performed using HTTP methods with standardized
status codes and content types for consistent API behavior.

Applications:
Web APIs, microservices, mobile backends, integration platforms, data
services, enterprise service layers, and any application requiring
standardized HTTP-based service interfaces with REST principles.
