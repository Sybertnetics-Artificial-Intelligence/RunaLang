Model-View-Controller Web Framework Architecture

This module provides comprehensive MVC framework implementation including
model management, view rendering, controller orchestration, and advanced
MVC patterns. Supports flexible MVC architectures with dependency injection,
middleware systems, and enterprise-grade web application development patterns.

Key Features:
- Complete MVC architecture with model, view, and controller separation
- Model layer with ORM integration and data validation
- View engine integration with template systems and rendering
- Controller routing and action method dispatch
- Dependency injection and service container management
- Middleware pipeline and request/response processing
- URL routing and parameter binding systems
- Model binding and validation with automatic data mapping
- View model pattern implementation and data transfer objects
- Action filters and cross-cutting concern handling
- RESTful API support with resource controllers
- Authentication and authorization integration
- Session and state management across MVC components
- Error handling and exception management in MVC context
- Performance optimization and caching strategies
- Testing support with mock objects and test harnesses
- Configuration management and environment-specific settings
- Logging and monitoring integration for MVC applications
- Security features including CSRF protection and input validation
- Internationalization and localization support
- Plugin and extension system for MVC framework
- Database migration and schema management tools
- Asset management and bundling for web resources
- Real-time features with WebSocket integration
- Enterprise patterns including repository and unit of work

Physical Foundation:
MVC architecture separates application concerns into models (data and business
logic), views (presentation layer), and controllers (request handling and
coordination). This separation enables maintainable, testable, and scalable
web applications with clear separation of responsibilities.

Applications:
Enterprise web applications, content management systems, e-commerce platforms,
API services, administration dashboards, and any web application requiring
structured architecture with clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
