Template Inheritance and Block System Management

This module provides comprehensive template inheritance capabilities including
block definition, extension mechanisms, and hierarchical template structures.
Supports advanced inheritance patterns with block overrides, nested templates,
and sophisticated template composition for scalable template architectures.

Key Features:
- Template inheritance with extends and block mechanisms
- Block definition and override system with multiple inheritance
- Template composition and mixin capabilities
- Hierarchical template resolution and loading
- Block content merging and super block functionality
- Template inheritance validation and conflict resolution
- Nested template structures and inclusion management
- Dynamic template hierarchy construction
- Template dependency tracking and circular reference detection
- Block scoping and visibility management
- Template inheritance debugging and visualization
- Performance optimization for inheritance chains
- Template versioning and compatibility in inheritance
- Advanced block manipulation and transformation
- Template inheritance caching and compilation optimization
- Cross-template variable and context inheritance
- Template fragment composition and reuse
- Conditional inheritance and dynamic template selection
- Template inheritance security and sandboxing
- Multi-level inheritance with complex hierarchies
- Template inheritance analytics and usage tracking
- Block content validation and type checking
- Template inheritance migration and upgrade tools
- Advanced inheritance patterns and custom mechanisms
- Template inheritance documentation and introspection

Physical Foundation:
Template inheritance creates hierarchical template structures where child
templates extend parent templates by defining blocks that override or extend
base template content. The system resolves inheritance chains, manages block
content, and ensures proper template composition during compilation.

Applications:
Web frameworks, content management systems, theme engines, email template
systems, documentation generators, and any application requiring structured
template hierarchies with reusable components and consistent layouts.
