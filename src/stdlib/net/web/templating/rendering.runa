Template Rendering Engine and Context Management

This module provides comprehensive template rendering capabilities including
context management, variable resolution, filter processing, and advanced
rendering features. Supports efficient template execution with optimized
data binding and context-aware output generation.

Key Features:
- High-performance template rendering with context management
- Variable resolution and data binding from context objects
- Template filter processing and transformation pipeline
- Function and helper method execution within templates
- Conditional rendering and control flow execution
- Loop and iteration processing with nested contexts
- Template context inheritance and scoping
- Lazy loading and on-demand variable resolution
- Template output formatting and escaping
- Error handling and graceful degradation during rendering
- Rendering performance optimization and caching
- Context validation and type checking
- Template debugging and trace information
- Asynchronous and streaming rendering support
- Memory-efficient rendering for large datasets
- Custom rendering pipeline and hook system
- Template output post-processing and transformation
- Rendering statistics and performance monitoring
- Context-aware template optimization
- Advanced rendering features and extensions

Physical Foundation:
Template rendering executes compiled template logic against provided data
contexts, resolving variables, applying filters, and generating final output.
The rendering engine manages execution state, context scoping, and output
generation while maintaining performance and memory efficiency.

Applications:
Web frameworks, content management systems, email template processors,
report generators, static site builders, and any system requiring dynamic
content generation from templates with data contexts.
