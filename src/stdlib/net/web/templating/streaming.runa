Streaming Template Rendering and Progressive Output

This module provides comprehensive streaming template rendering capabilities
including progressive output generation, chunked rendering, and advanced
streaming patterns. Supports real-time template processing with optimized
memory usage and responsive rendering for large datasets and long-running operations.

Key Features:
- Streaming template rendering with progressive output generation
- Chunked template processing and partial result delivery
- Asynchronous template rendering with non-blocking operations
- Memory-efficient streaming for large datasets and templates
- Real-time template updates and dynamic content streaming
- Template streaming with backpressure and flow control
- Progressive template compilation and incremental processing
- Streaming template composition and nested template handling
- Template streaming performance optimization and buffering
- Stream-based template caching and result persistence
- Error handling and recovery in streaming contexts
- Template streaming debugging and monitoring
- Streaming template security and resource management
- Cross-platform streaming compatibility and optimization
- Template streaming analytics and performance metrics
- Advanced streaming patterns and pipeline architectures
- Streaming template transformation and filtering
- Template streaming compression and encoding
- Concurrent template streaming and parallel processing
- Streaming template authentication and authorization
- Template streaming rate limiting and throttling
- Streaming template versioning and compatibility
- Enterprise streaming template management
- Template streaming integration patterns
- Advanced streaming template features and extensions

Physical Foundation:
Streaming template rendering processes templates incrementally, generating
output as soon as portions become available rather than waiting for complete
processing. This reduces memory usage, improves perceived performance, and
enables real-time template processing for responsive applications.

Applications:
Real-time web applications, progressive web apps, server-sent events,
streaming APIs, live dashboards, chat applications, and any system requiring
responsive template rendering with large or dynamic datasets.
