Reusable Template Components and Widget System

This module provides comprehensive reusable template component capabilities
including component definition, parameterization, and composition systems.
Supports advanced component architectures with state management, lifecycle
hooks, and sophisticated component interaction patterns for scalable templates.

Key Features:
- Reusable template component definition and registration
- Component parameterization and data binding systems
- Component lifecycle management and hooks
- Component state management and persistence
- Nested component composition and hierarchies
- Component event handling and communication
- Template widget library and component collections
- Component slot and content projection systems
- Dynamic component loading and lazy instantiation
- Component dependency injection and service integration
- Component styling and theming systems
- Component validation and type checking
- Component testing and development tools
- Component performance optimization and caching
- Component versioning and compatibility management
- Cross-component communication and messaging
- Component documentation and introspection
- Component packaging and distribution
- Component security and sandboxing
- Advanced component patterns and architectures
- Component analytics and usage tracking
- Component migration and upgrade tools
- Component debugging and development aids
- Template component marketplace integration
- Enterprise component library management

Physical Foundation:
Template components encapsulate reusable template functionality with defined
interfaces, parameters, and behaviors. The system manages component lifecycles,
state, and composition while providing efficient rendering and interaction
mechanisms for complex template architectures.

Applications:
Component-based web frameworks, design systems, UI libraries, content
management systems, email template systems, and any application requiring
reusable, maintainable template components with consistent behavior.
