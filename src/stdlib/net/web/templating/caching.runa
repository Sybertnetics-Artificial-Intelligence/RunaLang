Template Compilation Caching and Performance Optimization

This module provides comprehensive template caching capabilities including
compilation caching, result caching, and advanced cache management systems.
Supports multiple cache strategies, cache invalidation, and performance
optimization for template processing with intelligent cache warming and persistence.

Key Features:
- Template compilation result caching with multiple cache backends
- Template output caching with TTL and dependency-based invalidation
- Intelligent cache warming and precompilation strategies
- Multi-level cache hierarchies with hot/warm/cold storage tiers
- Cache invalidation strategies including tag-based and dependency tracking
- Template cache compression and serialization optimization
- Distributed caching support with cache synchronization
- Cache performance monitoring and optimization analytics
- Template cache security with access control and encryption
- Cache persistence and restoration across system restarts
- Adaptive caching with usage pattern analysis
- Template cache debugging and inspection tools
- Cache memory management with LRU and custom eviction policies
- Template dependency tracking for intelligent invalidation
- Cache statistics and performance metrics collection
- Template cache versioning and migration support
- Cross-template cache sharing and deduplication
- Cache warming automation and scheduling
- Template cache integration with CDN and edge caching
- Advanced cache optimization patterns and strategies
- Cache-aware template compilation and rendering
- Template cache consistency and coherence management
- Cache-based template performance optimization
- Enterprise template caching with clustering support
- Template cache federation and distributed architectures

Physical Foundation:
Template caching stores compiled templates, intermediate results, and final
outputs in memory or persistent storage to avoid recomputation. The system
manages cache lifecycles, invalidation, and optimization to provide fast
template processing while maintaining data consistency and freshness.

Applications:
High-performance web applications, content management systems, static site
generators, email template systems, and any application requiring optimized
template processing with reduced compilation and rendering overhead.
