Template Engine Framework and Backend Management

This module provides a comprehensive template engine framework supporting
multiple backend engines with pluggable architecture. Enables template
processing with various syntax systems, compilation strategies, and
rendering optimizations for web applications and content generation.

Key Features:
- Pluggable template engine architecture with multiple backends
- Template engine registration and discovery system
- Engine-agnostic template compilation and rendering
- Support for multiple template syntax formats (Jinja, Mustache, Handlebars, etc.)
- Template engine performance profiling and benchmarking
- Engine-specific optimization and caching strategies
- Cross-engine template compatibility and migration tools
- Template engine configuration and customization
- Engine lifecycle management and resource cleanup
- Template syntax validation and error reporting
- Engine feature detection and capability negotiation
- Template compilation pipeline management
- Engine-specific security and sandboxing features
- Template debugging and development tools
- Engine performance monitoring and metrics
- Template transformation and preprocessing
- Engine extension and plugin systems
- Cross-platform engine compatibility
- Template versioning and compatibility tracking
- Advanced template processing workflows

Physical Foundation:
Template engines transform template files with embedded logic into final
output by parsing syntax, building abstract syntax trees, and executing
rendering logic with provided data contexts. Different engines use varying
approaches for compilation, caching, and execution optimization.

Applications:
Web frameworks, static site generators, email template systems, report
generation, documentation systems, content management systems, and any
application requiring dynamic content generation from templates.
