Template Syntax Parsing and AST Generation

This module provides comprehensive template syntax parsing capabilities
including lexical analysis, syntax tree construction, and advanced parsing
features for various template languages. Supports multiple syntax formats
with extensible parsing architecture and error recovery.

Key Features:
- Multi-syntax template parsing (Jinja, Mustache, Handlebars, etc.)
- Lexical analysis and tokenization of template content
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation and manipulation
- Template syntax validation and error reporting
- Parser error recovery and diagnostic messages
- Custom syntax definition and extension support
- Template preprocessing and transformation
- Syntax highlighting and formatting support
- Parser performance optimization and caching
- Template macro and include resolution
- Variable and expression parsing with type inference
- Control structure parsing (loops, conditionals, etc.)
- Filter and function call parsing
- Comment and whitespace handling
- Template inheritance syntax processing
- Cross-syntax compatibility and migration tools
- Parser debugging and development tools
- Syntax tree optimization and simplification
- Template dependency analysis and extraction
- Advanced parsing features and extensions

Physical Foundation:
Template parsing transforms raw template text into structured representations
through lexical analysis, parsing, and AST construction. The parser handles
template-specific syntax while maintaining separation between template logic
and presentation content for clean code generation.

Applications:
Template engines, static site generators, code generators, documentation
systems, email template processors, and any system requiring structured
template parsing and syntax analysis.
