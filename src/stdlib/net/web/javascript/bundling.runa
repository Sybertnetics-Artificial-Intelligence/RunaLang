JavaScript Module Bundling and Packaging

This module provides comprehensive JavaScript bundling and packaging functionality including:
- Webpack-compatible bundling with advanced optimization features
- Rollup-style tree shaking and ES module bundling capabilities
- Parcel-like zero-configuration bundling with intelligent defaults
- Vite-inspired development server with hot module replacement
- Code splitting strategies for optimal loading performance
- Asset processing and optimization (images, fonts, CSS) within bundles
- Bundle analysis and visualization for size optimization
- Multi-target bundling for different deployment environments
- Micro-frontend bundling with module federation support
- Progressive web app (PWA) bundling with service worker generation
- Performance budgets and bundle size monitoring
- Advanced caching strategies and long-term asset optimization

Bundling Foundation:
JavaScript bundling combines multiple modules and assets into optimized
packages for deployment, enabling efficient loading, caching, and
execution while maintaining development productivity through
sophisticated build pipelines and optimization techniques.

Modern Bundling Features:
Support for ES modules, dynamic imports, code splitting, tree shaking,
and advanced optimization techniques that enable modern web application
architectures with optimal performance characteristics.
