JavaScript Minification and Code Optimization

This module provides comprehensive JavaScript minification and code optimization functionality including:
- JavaScript code minification with advanced compression techniques
- Variable and function name mangling for maximum size reduction
- Dead code elimination and unreachable code removal
- Control flow optimization and branch elimination
- Expression simplification and constant folding
- Property access optimization and dot notation conversion
- String literal optimization and escape sequence minimization
- Comment removal with configurable preservation rules
- Whitespace elimination while maintaining functionality
- UglifyJS and Terser-compatible optimization passes
- Source map preservation through minification process
- Performance-optimized minification for large JavaScript codebases

Minification Foundation:
JavaScript minification reduces file size and improves loading performance
through sophisticated code analysis and transformation techniques that
maintain functionality while eliminating redundancy and optimizing
code structure for maximum compression efficiency.

Optimization Strategy:
Multi-pass optimization pipeline with semantic analysis, control flow
optimization, and aggressive compression techniques that achieve maximum
size reduction while preserving JavaScript execution semantics.
