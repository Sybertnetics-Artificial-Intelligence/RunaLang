Runa-JavaScript Interoperability and Bridge

This module provides comprehensive Runa-JavaScript interoperability functionality including:
- Bidirectional function calling between Runa and JavaScript environments
- Automatic type conversion and marshalling for cross-language data exchange
- JavaScript object manipulation from Runa code with native JavaScript semantics
- Runa object exposure to JavaScript with proper memory management
- Promise and async/await integration for asynchronous operations
- Event handling and callback registration across language boundaries
- Error propagation and exception handling between language contexts
- Memory management coordination for shared objects and references
- Performance optimization for frequent interop operations
- WebAssembly integration for high-performance interoperability
- Node.js API bindings for server-side JavaScript integration
- Browser API bindings for web platform functionality access

Interoperability Foundation:
Runa-JavaScript interoperability enables seamless integration between
Runa and JavaScript ecosystems, allowing developers to leverage the
strengths of both languages while maintaining type safety and
performance characteristics across language boundaries.

Cross-Language Architecture:
Advanced interoperability system with automatic type conversion,
memory management coordination, and performance optimization that
enables transparent cross-language programming while preserving
the unique characteristics of each language environment.
