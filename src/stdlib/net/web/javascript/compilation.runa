JavaScript Compilation and Optimization

This module provides comprehensive JavaScript compilation and optimization functionality including:
- JavaScript-to-bytecode compilation with multiple target engines
- ECMAScript specification compliance with feature detection and polyfilling
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation and manipulation for code analysis
- Dead code elimination and tree shaking for bundle size optimization
- Control flow analysis and optimization for improved runtime performance
- Inlining optimization for function calls and constant propagation
- Loop optimization and unrolling for performance-critical code sections
- Type inference and optimization for dynamic JavaScript code
- Memory allocation optimization and garbage collection improvements
- Cross-compilation support for different JavaScript engine targets
- Profile-guided optimization using runtime execution data
- Advanced optimization passes including escape analysis and devirtualization

Compilation Foundation:
JavaScript compilation transforms source code into optimized executable
forms through sophisticated analysis and optimization techniques that
improve runtime performance while maintaining semantic correctness
and ECMAScript specification compliance.

Optimization Strategy:
Multi-pass optimization pipeline with interprocedural analysis,
data flow optimization, and target-specific code generation to
achieve maximum performance across different execution environments.
