JavaScript Transpilation and Language Transformation

This module provides comprehensive JavaScript transpilation and language transformation functionality including:
- TypeScript to JavaScript compilation with full type system support
- Babel-like JavaScript transformation with plugin ecosystem compatibility
- JSX transformation for React and other virtual DOM libraries
- Modern JavaScript (ES2015+) to legacy JavaScript (ES5) transpilation
- CoffeeScript, Flow, and other compile-to-JS language support
- Source map generation and preservation through transformation chains
- Custom syntax transformation with AST manipulation capabilities
- Performance-optimized transpilation for large codebases and build systems
- Incremental transpilation with intelligent caching strategies
- Plugin architecture for extensible transformation pipelines
- Integration with linting, type checking, and code analysis tools
- Multi-target transpilation for different deployment environments

Transpilation Foundation:
JavaScript transpilation enables the use of modern language features
and alternative syntaxes while maintaining compatibility with target
environments through sophisticated source-to-source compilation
and transformation processes.

Language Ecosystem Support:
Comprehensive support for TypeScript, JSX, Flow, CoffeeScript, and
other compile-to-JavaScript languages with unified transformation
pipeline and extensible plugin architecture for custom transformations.
