JavaScript Engine Embedding and Execution

This module provides comprehensive JavaScript engine embedding and execution functionality including:
- V8 JavaScript engine integration with full ECMAScript support
- JavaScriptCore (WebKit) engine embedding for cross-platform compatibility
- SpiderMonkey engine support with Mozilla JavaScript features
- QuickJS lightweight engine integration for resource-constrained environments
- JavaScript code execution with sandboxing and security controls
- ECMAScript module loading and dependency resolution
- CommonJS and AMD module system support with interoperability
- JavaScript-Runa bridge for seamless language interoperability
- Performance optimization with JIT compilation and caching
- Memory management and garbage collection integration
- Debugging and profiling tools for JavaScript execution
- Multi-threaded JavaScript execution with worker thread support

Engine Foundation:
JavaScript engine integration enables dynamic web content execution,
server-side JavaScript processing, and hybrid application development
while maintaining security boundaries and optimal performance
characteristics across different execution environments.

Multi-Engine Support:
Comprehensive support for major JavaScript engines with unified
API interface, allowing engine selection based on performance
requirements, memory constraints, and feature compatibility needs.
