- Home screen icon and shortcut integration
- App launch detection and handling
- Installation analytics and conversion tracking
- Custom installation UI and onboarding flows
- Platform-specific installation behaviors
- Installation criteria evaluation and validation
- Post-installation user experience optimization
- App update notifications and management
- Uninstallation handling and feedback collection
- Installation A/B testing and optimization
- Deep link handling for installed apps

Technical Foundation:
Implements Web App Manifest and BeforeInstallPrompt APIs with
intelligent prompt timing, installation flow optimization, and
comprehensive installation experience management.

Applications:
Essential for Progressive Web Apps requiring native app-like
installation experiences, home screen presence, and improved
user retention through app-style interactions.
