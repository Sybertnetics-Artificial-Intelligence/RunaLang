Background Synchronization for Progressive Web Apps

This module provides comprehensive background synchronization capabilities
for Progressive Web Apps including offline data queuing, automatic retry
mechanisms, conflict resolution, and seamless data synchronization when
network connectivity is restored.

Key Features:
- Background sync registration and management
- Offline request queuing and persistence
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Conflict detection and resolution strategies
- Data integrity and consistency management
- Batch synchronization for efficiency
- Priority-based sync ordering
- Bandwidth-aware synchronization
- Sync progress tracking and reporting
- Custom sync strategies for different data types
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Analytics and monitoring for sync performance

Technical Foundation:
Implements Background Sync API with service worker integration,
providing reliable data synchronization patterns for offline-capable
web applications with proper conflict resolution and data consistency.

Applications:
Essential for Progressive Web Apps requiring offline data entry,
form submissions, content creation, and any scenario requiring
reliable data synchronization across network conditions.
