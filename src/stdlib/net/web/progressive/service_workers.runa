Service Worker Integration and Management

This module provides comprehensive service worker lifecycle management,
registration, installation, and integration for Progressive Web Apps
including cache management, background sync, push notification handling,
and offline functionality coordination.

Key Features:
- Service worker registration and lifecycle management
- Installation and activation event handling
- Cache management and versioning strategies
- Offline-first and network-first caching patterns
- Background synchronization coordination
- Push notification message handling
- Service worker update mechanisms
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Message passing between main thread and service worker
- Precaching and runtime caching strategies
- Service worker debugging and diagnostics

Technical Foundation:
Implements Service Worker specification with proper lifecycle handling,
cache management, and event-driven architecture for reliable offline
functionality and enhanced web application performance.

Applications:
Essential for Progressive Web Apps requiring offline functionality,
background processing, push notifications, and enhanced performance
through intelligent caching strategies.
