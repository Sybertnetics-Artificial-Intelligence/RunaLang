- Online/offline state detection and handling
- Intelligent resource prioritization for offline access
- Data synchronization when connectivity returns
- Offline form submission and queuing
- Cache invalidation and update strategies
- Bandwidth-aware caching for optimal performance
- Progressive enhancement for offline features

Technical Foundation:
Implements comprehensive offline-first architecture with intelligent
caching, storage management, and synchronization patterns for robust
offline web application experiences.

Applications:
Essential for Progressive Web Apps requiring reliable offline
functionality, data persistence, and seamless user experiences
across varying network conditions and connectivity scenarios.
