Push Notifications for Progressive Web Apps

This module provides comprehensive push notification functionality for
Progressive Web Apps including subscription management, message handling,
notification display customization, and integration with push services
for real-time user engagement and re-engagement.

Key Features:
- Push subscription registration and management
- Integration with web push services (FCM, Mozilla, Microsoft)
- Notification payload handling and processing
- Custom notification UI and interaction handling
- Push message encryption and security
- Notification scheduling and batching
- User permission management and opt-in flows
- Notification analytics and engagement tracking
- Rich notification content with actions and images
- Background notification processing
- Notification badge management
- Cross-platform notification compatibility

Technical Foundation:
Implements Web Push Protocol (RFC 8030) and Push API with proper
encryption, subscription management, and service worker integration
for reliable push notification delivery.

Applications:
Essential for Progressive Web Apps requiring user engagement,
real-time updates, marketing communications, and re-engagement
features across desktop and mobile platforms.
