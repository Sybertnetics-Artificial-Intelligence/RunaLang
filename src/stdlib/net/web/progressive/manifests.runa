Progressive Web App Manifest Management

This module provides comprehensive web application manifest generation,
validation, and management for Progressive Web Apps including manifest
creation, icon management, installation prompts, and standards-compliant
manifest handling for enhanced web app experiences.

Key Features:
- Web app manifest generation and validation
- Icon set generation and optimization for multiple devices
- Application metadata and branding configuration
- Installation criteria and prompts management
- Theme color and display mode configuration
- Start URL and scope definition for PWA navigation
- Orientation and category specification
- Manifest caching and update management
- Platform-specific manifest customization
- Deep linking and URL handling configuration
- App shortcuts and menu item definitions
- Standards compliance with W3C Web App Manifest spec

Technical Foundation:
Implements W3C Web App Manifest specification with proper JSON
generation, validation, and browser compatibility for creating
installable web applications with native app-like experiences.

Applications:
Essential for Progressive Web Apps requiring installation capabilities,
app-like experiences, branding consistency, and offline functionality
across desktop and mobile platforms.
