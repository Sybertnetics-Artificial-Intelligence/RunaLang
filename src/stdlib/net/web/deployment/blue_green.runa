Blue-Green Foundation:
Built on robust deployment infrastructure with intelligent orchestration,
comprehensive validation, and seamless traffic management to provide
reliable zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback capabilities
while maintaining high availability and system integrity.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for minimal deployment overhead with efficient resource
provisioning, intelligent traffic switching, and comprehensive validation
to ensure fast deployment cycles while maintaining system performance
and reliability throughout the entire deployment process.
