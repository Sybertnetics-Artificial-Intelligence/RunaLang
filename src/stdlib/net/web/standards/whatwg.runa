WHATWG Standards Implementation and HTML Living Standard

This module provides comprehensive WHATWG standards implementation
including HTML Living Standard, DOM Living Standard, and other WHATWG
specifications. Supports modern web standards with continuous updates
and enterprise-grade compliance for evolving web technologies.

Key Features:
- HTML Living Standard implementation and compliance
- DOM Living Standard with modern API support
- Fetch Living Standard implementation
- URL Living Standard compliance
- Streams Living Standard support
- Web IDL specification implementation
- Console Standard implementation
- Encoding Standard support
- MIME Sniffing Standard compliance
- Storage Standard implementation
- XMLHttpRequest Living Standard
- File API Living Standard support
- Progressive enhancement and feature detection
- Living standards update tracking
- Compatibility with legacy implementations
- Browser implementation testing
- Standards evolution monitoring
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance optimization for living standards
- Security considerations for evolving specs
- Developer tools integration
- Community contribution support
- Standards feedback and participation
- Enterprise deployment strategies
- Advanced WHATWG patterns and practices

Physical Foundation:
WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) develops
living standards that evolve continuously rather than versioned
specifications. These standards reflect the current state of web
technology and are implemented by major browsers.

Applications:
Modern web browsers, web applications, progressive web apps, developer
tools, testing frameworks, and any web technology requiring cutting-edge
standards compliance with continuous evolution.
