Semantic Web Standards Implementation

This module provides comprehensive semantic web standards compliance capabilities
including RDF, microformats, structured data, and linked data support. Supports
Schema.org, JSON-LD, RDFa, and semantic markup standards for modern web development.

Key Features:
- RDF processing and graph operations
- Schema.org structured data implementation
- JSON-LD parsing and serialization
- Microformats extraction and validation
- RDFa markup processing
- Semantic validation and consistency checking
- Ontology management and reasoning
- Linked data operations and SPARQL queries
