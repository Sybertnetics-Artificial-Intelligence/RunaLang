W3C Standards Compliance and Implementation

This module provides comprehensive W3C standards compliance capabilities
including HTML, CSS, DOM, and web API standards implementation. Supports
standards validation, compliance checking, and enterprise-grade web
standards adherence for modern web development.

Key Features:
- Complete W3C standards compliance framework
- HTML5 specification compliance and validation
- CSS3 standards implementation and checking
- DOM API standards compliance and testing
- Web API standards implementation (Fetch, WebRTC, etc.)
- XML and XHTML standards support
- SVG standards compliance and validation
- Web Components standards implementation
- Progressive Web App (PWA) standards support
- Accessibility standards compliance (WCAG integration)
- Internationalization standards (i18n) support
- Web security standards implementation
- Performance standards and optimization guidelines
- Mobile web standards and responsive design compliance
- Standards validation and testing tools
- Cross-browser standards compatibility
- Standards documentation and reference
- Compliance reporting and certification
- Standards migration and upgrade tools
- Enterprise standards governance
- Custom standards extension framework
- Standards monitoring and tracking
- Best practices enforcement
- Standards training and education resources
- Advanced standards implementation patterns

Physical Foundation:
W3C standards define the fundamental technologies and protocols that power
the World Wide Web. Implementation ensures interoperability, accessibility,
and consistent behavior across different browsers and platforms while
maintaining forward and backward compatibility.

Applications:
Web browsers, web applications, content management systems, development
tools, testing frameworks, and any web-based system requiring standards
compliance and cross-platform compatibility.
