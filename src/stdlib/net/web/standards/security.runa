Web Security Standards Implementation

This module provides comprehensive web security standards compliance capabilities
including CSP, CORS, OWASP security guidelines, and vulnerability protection.
Supports enterprise-grade security implementation for modern web applications.

Key Features:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) management and validation
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implementation
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability protection
- Security headers management and validation
- Authentication and authorization security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Cryptographic security operations
- Compliance validation and reporting
