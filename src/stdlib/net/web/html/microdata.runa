Microdata and Structured Data

This module provides comprehensive microdata and structured data functionality including:
- Schema.org microdata implementation with complete vocabulary support
- JSON-LD structured data generation and validation
- RDFa markup processing and semantic annotation
- Open Graph Protocol metadata generation and optimization
- Twitter Card metadata creation and validation
- Rich snippets generation for enhanced search results
- Structured data testing and validation against Google guidelines
- Semantic HTML enhancement with machine-readable annotations
- Knowledge graph integration and entity linking
- Product data markup for e-commerce applications
- Event and organization data structuring
- Performance-optimized structured data processing for large-scale applications

Structured Data Foundation:
Structured data enables search engines and other systems to understand
web content semantically, improving discoverability, rich snippets
display, and integration with knowledge graphs while maintaining
clean separation between presentation and semantic meaning.

Standards Compliance:
Full support for Schema.org vocabulary, JSON-LD specification,
RDFa 1.1, Open Graph Protocol, and Twitter Card markup with
validation against current search engine requirements and guidelines.
