HTML Parsing and DOM Building

This module provides comprehensive HTML parsing and DOM building functionality including:
- HTML5-compliant parsing with error recovery and validation
- DOM tree construction with proper hierarchy and relationships
- Fragment parsing for partial HTML content processing
- Streaming HTML parsing for large documents and real-time processing
- Custom parser configuration with strict and lenient modes
- XML and XHTML parsing with namespace support
- HTML entity decoding and character reference resolution
- Malformed HTML recovery and sanitization during parsing
- Source location tracking for debugging and error reporting
- Integration with HTML validation and semantic analysis
- Performance-optimized parsing for high-throughput applications
- Memory-efficient parsing for resource-constrained environments

Parser Foundation:
HTML parsing is fundamental to web content processing, requiring robust
implementation that handles the complexities of real-world HTML content
while maintaining compliance with HTML5 specifications and providing
excellent error recovery for malformed documents.

Standards Compliance:
Implements HTML5 parsing algorithm with full support for tokenization,
tree construction, and error handling as specified by WHATWG HTML
Living Standard with extensions for modern web development needs.
