Form Processing and Validation

This module provides comprehensive form processing and validation functionality including:
- Dynamic form generation with configurable field types and layouts
- Client-side and server-side form validation with real-time feedback
- Form data serialization and deserialization with multiple formats
- File upload handling with security validation and progress tracking
- Multi-step form workflows with state management and navigation
- Form accessibility compliance with WCAG guidelines and ARIA support
- CSRF protection and security token management
- Form data sanitization and XSS prevention
- Integration with popular form validation libraries and frameworks
- Custom validation rules with extensible rule engine
- Form submission handling with error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Performance optimization for large forms and high-traffic scenarios

Form Foundation:
Forms are essential for user interaction in web applications, requiring
robust processing, validation, and security measures while maintaining
excellent user experience and accessibility standards across all
devices and user capabilities.

Security Focus:
All form operations include comprehensive security measures against
injection attacks, CSRF, data tampering, and unauthorized access
while preserving usability and performance characteristics.
