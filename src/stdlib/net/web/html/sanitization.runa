HTML Sanitization and XSS Prevention

This module provides comprehensive HTML sanitization and XSS prevention functionality including:
- XSS attack prevention with comprehensive payload detection and neutralization
- HTML content sanitization with safe element and attribute whitelisting
- User-generated content filtering with customizable security policies
- DOM-based XSS protection with client-side script analysis
- Stored XSS prevention with persistent content sanitization
- Reflected XSS mitigation with input validation and output encoding
- Content Security Policy (CSP) integration and enforcement
- HTML purification for email content and rich text editors
- Safe HTML generation with context-aware encoding
- Malicious script detection and removal with advanced pattern matching
- Integration with web application firewalls and security frameworks
- Performance-optimized sanitization for high-throughput applications

Security Foundation:
HTML sanitization is critical for web application security, protecting
against code injection attacks while preserving legitimate content
functionality through intelligent filtering and safe content
transformation techniques.

Attack Vector Coverage:
Protects against script injection, event handler abuse, style-based
attacks, iframe exploits, form manipulation, and advanced evasion
techniques while maintaining content usability and user experience.
