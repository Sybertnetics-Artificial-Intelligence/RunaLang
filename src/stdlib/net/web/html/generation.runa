HTML Generation and Templating

This module provides comprehensive HTML generation and templating functionality including:
- Dynamic HTML generation with structured document building
- Template engine with variable substitution and control flow
- Component-based HTML generation with reusable elements
- Form generation with validation and accessibility features
- Responsive HTML generation with device-specific optimization
- SEO-optimized HTML generation with metadata and structured data
- Accessibility-compliant HTML generation (WCAG 2.1/2.2)
- HTML minification and optimization during generation
- Server-side rendering support for dynamic content
- Integration with CSS and JavaScript generation systems
- Multilingual HTML generation with internationalization support
- Performance-optimized generation for high-throughput applications

Generation Foundation:
HTML generation enables dynamic web content creation through programmatic
document construction, template processing, and component composition
while maintaining semantic correctness, accessibility standards, and
optimal performance characteristics.

Template Engine:
Advanced templating system supporting conditionals, loops, partials,
layouts, and custom filters with compile-time optimization and runtime
efficiency for complex document generation scenarios.
