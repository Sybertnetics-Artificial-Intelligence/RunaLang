HTML Validation and Standards

This module provides comprehensive HTML validation and standards compliance functionality including:
- HTML5 specification validation with complete rule checking
- XHTML validation with XML well-formedness verification
- Accessibility validation (WCAG 2.1/2.2, Section 508)
- SEO validation with best practice recommendations
- Performance validation with Core Web Vitals analysis
- Security validation with XSS and injection vulnerability detection
- Semantic HTML validation with proper element usage verification
- Custom validation rules with extensible rule engine
- Batch validation for multiple documents and sites
- Integration with development workflows and CI/CD pipelines
- Real-time validation with live feedback during development
- Validation reporting with detailed error analysis and recommendations

Validation Foundation:
HTML validation ensures web content meets standards, accessibility
requirements, and best practices while identifying potential issues
early in the development process through comprehensive analysis
and actionable feedback mechanisms.

Standards Coverage:
Supports validation against HTML5, XHTML 1.0/1.1, HTML 4.01,
accessibility standards (WCAG, Section 508), and custom
organizational standards with detailed compliance reporting.
