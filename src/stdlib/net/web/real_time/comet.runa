Comet and Reverse Ajax Implementation

This module provides comprehensive Comet implementation including reverse
Ajax techniques, HTTP streaming, and server push mechanisms for real-time
web communication using traditional HTTP infrastructure without requiring
WebSocket support.

Key Features:
- HTTP streaming for continuous server-to-client communication
- Reverse Ajax with hidden iframe and XMLHttpRequest streaming
- Forever frame technique for persistent connections
- JSONP long polling for cross-domain communication
- Connection management and automatic reconnection
- Browser compatibility and fallback strategies
- Bandwidth optimization and connection pooling
- Message queuing and delivery guarantees
- Authentication and session management
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Integration with existing web frameworks
- Performance monitoring and optimization

Technical Foundation:
Implements Comet patterns using HTTP 1.1 persistent connections,
chunked transfer encoding, and various browser-specific techniques
for reliable server-push communication over HTTP.

Applications:
Essential for real-time web applications requiring broad browser
compatibility, legacy system support, and scenarios where newer
real-time technologies are not available or suitable.
