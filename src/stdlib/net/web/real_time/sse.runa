Server-Sent Events Implementation

This module provides comprehensive Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation
for real-time server-to-client communication including event streaming,
connection management, event formatting, and advanced features for
building scalable real-time web applications with unidirectional updates.

Key Features:
- Server-Sent Events streaming server implementation
- Event formatting and custom event types
- Connection management and client tracking
- Automatic reconnection handling for clients
- Event history and replay functionality
- Multi-channel event broadcasting
- Authentication and authorization for event streams
- Compression and bandwidth optimization
- Event filtering and subscription management
- Heartbeat and connection health monitoring
- Integration with existing HTTP infrastructure
- Cross-origin support and security controls

Technical Foundation:
Implements W3C Server-Sent Events specification with proper HTTP streaming,
event formatting, and connection management for reliable real-time
server-to-client communication.

Applications:
Essential for real-time applications requiring server-initiated updates
including live feeds, notifications, stock tickers, chat systems,
and any scenario requiring push-based data delivery.
