WebSocket Client and Server Integration

This module provides comprehensive WebSocket implementation for real-time
bidirectional communication including connection management, message
handling, protocol support, authentication, and advanced features for
building scalable real-time web applications.

Key Features:
- WebSocket client and server implementation
- Connection lifecycle management and heartbeat
- Message framing and protocol handling
- Binary and text message support
- WebSocket subprotocol negotiation
- Connection authentication and authorization
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Message queuing and delivery guarantees
- Compression and extension support
- Connection pooling and load balancing
- Real-time metrics and monitoring
- Integration with existing HTTP infrastructure

Technical Foundation:
Implements RFC 6455 WebSocket Protocol with proper handshake handling,
frame processing, and connection management for reliable real-time
communication between web clients and servers.

Applications:
Essential for real-time applications including chat systems, live updates,
collaborative editing, gaming, trading platforms, and any scenario
requiring low-latency bidirectional communication.
