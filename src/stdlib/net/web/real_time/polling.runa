Long Polling and Short Polling Mechanisms

This module provides comprehensive polling implementations for real-time
communication including long polling, short polling, adaptive polling,
and optimization strategies for efficient server-client communication
when WebSocket or SSE alternatives are not available.

Key Features:
- Long polling with timeout and connection management
- Short polling with configurable intervals
- Adaptive polling based on activity and network conditions
- Connection pooling and request optimization
- Bandwidth-aware polling frequency adjustment
- Timeout handling and exponential backoff
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Polling state management and lifecycle
- Integration with existing HTTP infrastructure
- Cross-origin support and security controls
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Fallback strategies for unreliable connections

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient HTTP-based polling mechanisms with intelligent
timeout handling, connection management, and adaptive algorithms
for reliable real-time communication over standard HTTP.

Applications:
Essential for real-time applications requiring broad compatibility,
legacy system integration, and scenarios where WebSocket or SSE
are not available or suitable for the deployment environment.
