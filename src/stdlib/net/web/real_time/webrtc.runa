WebRTC Peer-to-Peer Communication

This module provides comprehensive WebRTC implementation for real-time
peer-to-peer communication including signaling, media streaming, data
channels, connection management, and advanced features for building
scalable real-time communication applications.

Key Features:
- WebRTC peer connection management and signaling
- Audio and video media streaming capabilities
- Bidirectional data channels for arbitrary data transfer
- NAT traversal with STUN and TURN servers
- Media device enumeration and capture
- Screen sharing and display capture
- Adaptive bitrate and quality control
- Connection state monitoring and recovery
- Multi-party communication support
- Recording and media processing
- Security and encryption handling
- Cross-platform compatibility and optimization

Technical Foundation:
Implements WebRTC 1.0 specification with proper signaling protocols,
media handling, and peer-to-peer networking for direct browser-to-browser
communication with minimal server involvement.

Applications:
Essential for video conferencing, voice calls, file sharing,
collaborative applications, gaming, live streaming, and any
scenario requiring direct peer-to-peer communication.
