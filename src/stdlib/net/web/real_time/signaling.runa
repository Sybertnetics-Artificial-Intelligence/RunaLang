Real-Time Signaling Protocols and Coordination

This module provides comprehensive signaling protocol implementation for
real-time communication systems including WebRTC signaling, session
negotiation, peer discovery, and coordination mechanisms for establishing
and managing real-time communication sessions.

Key Features:
- WebRTC signaling protocol implementation (offer/answer model)
- Session Description Protocol (SDP) handling and manipulation
- ICE candidate exchange and coordination
- Peer discovery and matchmaking services
- Multi-party signaling coordination
- Signaling server and client implementations
- Protocol negotiation and capability exchange
- Authentication and authorization for signaling
- NAT traversal coordination with STUN/TURN servers
- Signaling message routing and delivery
- Connection state synchronization
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

Technical Foundation:
Implements JSEP (JavaScript Session Establishment Protocol) and WebRTC
signaling standards with proper SDP handling, ICE coordination, and
peer-to-peer session establishment protocols.

Applications:
Essential for WebRTC applications, video conferencing systems, voice
calling platforms, peer-to-peer file sharing, and any real-time
communication requiring session establishment and coordination.
