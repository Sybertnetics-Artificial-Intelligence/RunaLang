Asset Bundling and Concatenation

This module provides comprehensive asset bundling and concatenation
capabilities for web applications including JavaScript bundling, CSS
combining, dependency resolution, code splitting, and optimization
strategies for efficient asset delivery and performance.

Key Features:
- JavaScript module bundling and dependency resolution
- CSS file concatenation and optimization
- Asset dependency graph analysis and resolution
- Code splitting and dynamic import handling
- Bundle optimization and dead code elimination
- Source map generation and debugging support
- Asset fingerprinting and cache busting
- Incremental bundling and build optimization
- Multi-format asset support (ES6, CommonJS, AMD)
- Bundle size analysis and optimization recommendations
- Lazy loading and chunk optimization
- Integration with build tools and workflows

Technical Foundation:
Implements modern bundling strategies with dependency resolution,
tree shaking, and optimization techniques for efficient web asset
delivery with minimal bundle sizes and optimal loading performance.

Applications:
Essential for web applications requiring optimized asset delivery,
reduced load times, improved caching strategies, and efficient
resource management in production environments.
