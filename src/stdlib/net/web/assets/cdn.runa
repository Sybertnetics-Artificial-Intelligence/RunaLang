CDN Integration and Content Distribution

This module provides comprehensive Content Delivery Network (CDN)
integration and management capabilities including asset distribution,
cache management, global delivery optimization, and performance
monitoring for efficient worldwide content delivery.

Key Features:
- Multi-CDN provider integration and management
- Asset distribution and deployment automation
- Cache invalidation and purge management
- Geographic distribution and edge location optimization
- Load balancing and failover across CDN providers
- Real-time analytics and performance monitoring
- SSL/TLS certificate management for CDN endpoints
- Custom domain configuration and DNS management
- Bandwidth optimization and cost management
- API integration with major CDN providers
- Asset versioning and rollback capabilities
- Security and access control for distributed assets

Technical Foundation:
Implements integration with major CDN providers (CloudFlare, AWS CloudFront,
Azure CDN, etc.) with intelligent distribution strategies, performance
optimization, and comprehensive monitoring for global content delivery.

Applications:
Essential for global web applications requiring fast content delivery,
reduced latency, improved user experience, and scalable asset distribution
across geographic regions and diverse network conditions.
