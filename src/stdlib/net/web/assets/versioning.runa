Asset Versioning and Cache Busting

This module provides comprehensive asset versioning and cache busting
capabilities including content-based hashing, version management,
deployment coordination, and cache invalidation strategies for
optimal asset delivery and browser cache management.

Key Features:
- Content-based hash generation for cache busting
- Semantic versioning for asset releases
- Asset dependency tracking and version coordination
- Manifest generation for version mapping
- Automated cache invalidation strategies
- Rolling deployment support with version rollback
- Cross-environment version synchronization
- Integration with build pipelines and deployment systems
- Version history tracking and audit trails
- Performance impact analysis of versioning strategies
- Custom versioning schemes and naming conventions
- Integration with CDN and caching infrastructure

Technical Foundation:
Implements robust versioning strategies with content fingerprinting,
dependency management, and intelligent cache invalidation for
reliable asset delivery and optimal browser caching behavior.

Applications:
Essential for production web applications requiring reliable cache
management, deployment consistency, efficient browser caching,
and seamless asset updates without cache-related issues.
