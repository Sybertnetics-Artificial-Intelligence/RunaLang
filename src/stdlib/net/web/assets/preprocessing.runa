- Error handling and validation throughout preprocessing
- Integration with build tools and development servers
- Caching and incremental processing for performance
- Plugin system for extensible preprocessing capabilities

Technical Foundation:
Implements comprehensive preprocessing workflows with support for
popular preprocessors, intelligent caching, and pipeline optimization
for efficient asset transformation and development workflows.

Applications:
