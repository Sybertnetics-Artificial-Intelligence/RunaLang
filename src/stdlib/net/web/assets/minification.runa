Asset Minification and Compression

This module provides comprehensive asset minification and compression
capabilities for web applications including JavaScript minification, CSS
optimization, HTML compression, and advanced compression techniques for
optimal asset delivery and performance optimization.

Key Features:
- JavaScript minification with variable renaming and dead code elimination
- CSS minification with property optimization and redundancy removal
- HTML minification with whitespace removal and tag optimization
- Advanced compression algorithms (Gzip, Brotli, Deflate)
- Source map preservation during minification
- Conditional minification based on environment
- Custom minification rules and configurations
- Multi-threaded processing for large codebases
- Incremental minification for build optimization
- Integration with bundling and build pipelines
- Performance monitoring and size analysis
- Format-specific optimization strategies

Technical Foundation:
Implements industry-standard minification techniques with advanced
optimization algorithms, compression strategies, and performance
monitoring for maximum asset size reduction without functionality loss.

Applications:
Essential for production web applications requiring minimal asset sizes,
reduced bandwidth usage, improved loading performance, and optimized
user experience across various network conditions.
