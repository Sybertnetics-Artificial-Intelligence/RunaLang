Aether HTTP Request Object

This module provides comprehensive HTTP request handling and processing including:
- HTTP request parsing with support for all standard methods and headers
- Multipart form data handling with file upload processing
- JSON and XML request body parsing with schema validation
- URL parameter extraction and query string parsing
- Cookie management with secure handling and validation
- Authentication header processing and token extraction
- Request validation with type-safe parameter checking
- Content negotiation and Accept header processing
- Request streaming for large payload handling
- Pattern-intelligent request analysis and optimization
- AI-ready hooks for optional request enhancement and personalization
- Security validation with CSRF protection and input sanitization
- Performance optimization with zero-allocation parsing where possible
- Request caching and memoization for repeated patterns

Request Foundation:
The Aether request object provides a comprehensive, type-safe interface
for HTTP request handling with pattern-intelligent processing and
AI-ready hooks for optional enhancement while maintaining zero overhead
when advanced features are not utilized.

Type-System First:
Leverages Runa's advanced type system for compile-time request validation,
automatic parameter conversion, and type-safe request handling that
eliminates runtime errors and provides excellent developer experience.
