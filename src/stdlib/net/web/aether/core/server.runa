Aether HTTP Server Implementation

This module provides the core HTTP server implementation for the Aether web framework including:
- High-performance HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 server with connection multiplexing
- WebSocket support with real-time bidirectional communication
- TLS/SSL encryption with modern cipher suites and certificate management
- Connection pooling and keep-alive management for optimal resource usage
- Request routing and middleware pipeline integration
- Static file serving with caching and compression optimization
- Virtual host support for multi-domain applications
- Load balancing and clustering capabilities for horizontal scaling
- Graceful shutdown and connection draining for zero-downtime deployments
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection for operational insights
- Pattern-intelligent request preprocessing and optimization
- AI-ready hooks for optional intelligent traffic analysis
- Memory-efficient streaming for large request/response handling
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms

Server Foundation:
The Aether server is designed as a high-performance, pattern-intelligent HTTP
server that provides AI-ready hooks for optional intelligent features while
maintaining zero overhead when AI capabilities are not utilized.

Performance First:
Optimized for maximum throughput with zero-allocation request handling,
efficient memory management, and intelligent connection pooling that
adapts to traffic patterns for optimal performance.
