Aether HTTP Response Object

This module provides comprehensive HTTP response generation and formatting including:
- HTTP response construction with proper status codes and headers
- Content serialization with JSON, XML, HTML, and binary support
- Response compression with intelligent algorithm selection
- Cookie setting and management with security attributes
- Cache control header generation with optimal caching strategies
- Content type detection and automatic header setting
- Response streaming for large content and real-time data
- Error response generation with consistent formatting
- Security header injection with CSRF and XSS protection
- Performance optimization with zero-allocation response building
- Pattern-intelligent response optimization based on client capabilities
- AI-ready hooks for optional response personalization and enhancement
- Response validation and sanitization for security compliance
- Bandwidth optimization with adaptive compression and format selection

Response Foundation:
The Aether response object provides a comprehensive, type-safe interface
for HTTP response generation with intelligent optimization and AI-ready
hooks for optional enhancement while maintaining optimal performance
and security by default.

Performance First:
Optimized for zero-allocation response building with intelligent content
negotiation, efficient serialization, and pattern-based optimization
that adapts to client capabilities and network conditions.
