Aether Request/Response Context Management

This module provides comprehensive request and response context management including:
- Request/response lifecycle context with state management
- Session management with secure storage and validation
- User authentication and authorization context tracking
- Request correlation and distributed tracing support
- Performance context with timing and resource usage metrics
- Security context with threat detection and audit trails
- Pattern-intelligent context optimization and caching
- AI-ready hooks for optional context enhancement and personalization
- Thread-safe context sharing across middleware and handlers
- Context inheritance and propagation through request pipeline
- Error context preservation for debugging and monitoring
- Resource cleanup and context disposal for memory management
- Context serialization for distributed processing and storage
- Custom context extensions for application-specific requirements

Context Foundation:
The Aether context system provides a comprehensive, thread-safe foundation
for request/response state management with intelligent optimization and
AI-ready hooks while maintaining excellent performance and security.

Type-System First:
Leverages Runa's type system for compile-time context validation,
type-safe context access, and automatic context lifecycle management
that prevents memory leaks and ensures proper resource cleanup.
