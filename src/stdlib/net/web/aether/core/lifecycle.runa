Aether Application Lifecycle Management

This module provides comprehensive application lifecycle management including:
- Application startup and shutdown with graceful transitions
- Service lifecycle coordination with dependency resolution
- Plugin lifecycle management with proper initialization order
- Configuration hot-reloading with zero-downtime updates
- Health monitoring and readiness probes for production deployments
- Resource management with automatic cleanup and optimization
- Event-driven lifecycle hooks with custom handler registration
- Graceful degradation under load and resource constraints
- Performance monitoring during lifecycle transitions
- Pattern-intelligent lifecycle optimization based on usage patterns
- AI-ready hooks for optional intelligent lifecycle management
- Error recovery and resilience during lifecycle operations
- Distributed lifecycle coordination for multi-instance deployments
- Development mode features with hot-reloading and debugging support

Lifecycle Foundation:
The Aether lifecycle system provides robust, event-driven lifecycle
management with intelligent optimization and AI-ready hooks while
ensuring reliable operation and graceful handling of all transitions.

Performance First:
Optimized for minimal overhead during normal operation with efficient
resource management, intelligent caching of lifecycle state, and
pattern-based optimization of startup and shutdown sequences.
