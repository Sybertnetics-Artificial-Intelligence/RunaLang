Aether Web Application Core

This module provides the main application class and lifecycle management for the Aether web framework including:
- Application initialization and configuration with type-safe settings
- Service discovery and dependency injection with plugin architecture
- Application lifecycle management with startup and shutdown hooks
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection with real-time analytics
- Plugin system for AI service integration and extensibility
- Configuration validation and environment-specific settings
- Service registry for external integrations and microservices
- Application state management with thread-safe operations
- Health monitoring and readiness probes for production deployments
- Graceful degradation and fault tolerance mechanisms
- Development mode features with hot reloading and debugging
- Production optimizations with resource pooling and caching

Application Foundation:
The Aether application core provides a robust, type-safe foundation
for building modern web applications that are AI-ready, pattern-intelligent,
and performance-first while maintaining simplicity and predictability
in core operations and extensibility points.

AI-Ready Architecture:
Plugin system designed for seamless integration with external AI services,
telemetry collection for future ML training, and clean interfaces for
custom intelligence providers while maintaining zero AI overhead
when AI features are not utilized.
