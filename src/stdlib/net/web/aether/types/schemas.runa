OpenAPI Schema Generation and Management

This module provides comprehensive schema generation capabilities for
Aether web types, including automatic OpenAPI/JSON Schema generation
from Runa type definitions, schema validation, documentation generation,
and integration with API development workflows.

Key Features:
- Automatic OpenAPI 3.0 schema generation from Runa types
- JSON Schema generation with full specification compliance
- Type introspection and metadata extraction
- Schema validation and compatibility checking
- API documentation generation with examples
- Schema versioning and evolution management
- Custom schema annotations and documentation
- Integration with validation system for consistency
- Multi-format schema export (JSON, YAML, XML)
- Schema comparison and diff generation
- Type safety verification between schema and implementation
- Performance-optimized schema processing and caching

Technical Foundation:
Implements comprehensive schema generation using Runa's type system
reflection capabilities, producing standards-compliant schemas with
full documentation and validation support.

Applications:
Essential for API development, documentation generation, client SDK
generation, and maintaining type safety between API contracts and
implementation in modern web services.
