Type Validation and Error Generation System

This module provides comprehensive validation capabilities for Aether web
types, including declarative validation rules, automatic error response
generation, and integration hooks for custom validation logic. The system
enables self-validating types with compile-time and runtime guarantees.

Key Features:
- Declarative validation rule definitions and evaluation
- Built-in validation types (required, min/max, patterns, formats)
- Custom validation function registration and execution
- Automatic error response generation with localization
- Field-level and object-level validation strategies
- Validation rule composition and complex constraints
- Performance-optimized validation execution
- Validation result aggregation and reporting
- Type-safe validation with compile-time checking
- Integration with request/response validation pipeline
- Conditional validation based on context
- Validation caching for repeated operations

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient validation algorithms with rule compilation,
constraint evaluation, and error message generation optimized for
web request/response validation with minimal performance overhead.

Applications:
Essential for building robust web applications with automatic input
validation, type safety enforcement, and user-friendly error handling
in REST APIs, web forms, and data processing pipelines.
