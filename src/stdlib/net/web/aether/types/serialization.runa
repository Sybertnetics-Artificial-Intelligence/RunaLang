Request/Response Serialization System

This module provides comprehensive serialization capabilities for Aether
web types, including automatic format detection, type-driven serialization
and deserialization, content negotiation, and custom serializer registration
for seamless data transformation between various formats.

Key Features:
- Automatic format detection based on content type and Accept headers
- Type-driven serialization with compile-time safety guarantees
- Multi-format support (JSON, XML, YAML, MessagePack, Protocol Buffers)
- Content negotiation with quality values and format preferences
- Custom serializer registration and plugin architecture
- Streaming serialization for large datasets and real-time processing
- Schema-aware serialization with validation integration
- Performance optimization with serialization caching
- Error handling with detailed serialization failure reporting
- Charset handling and encoding conversion
- Compression integration for serialized data
- Versioning support for backward compatibility

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient serialization algorithms with format detection,
type introspection, and streaming capabilities optimized for web
request/response processing with minimal memory overhead.

Applications:
Essential for REST APIs, data exchange formats, content negotiation,
and any web service requiring flexible serialization between different
data formats and client preferences.
