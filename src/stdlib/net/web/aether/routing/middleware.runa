Aether Middleware Pipeline Management

This module provides comprehensive middleware pipeline management for the Aether web framework including:
- Middleware registration and configuration with priority-based ordering
- Pipeline composition and execution with context propagation
- Conditional middleware execution based on request characteristics
- Middleware performance monitoring and optimization
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms in middleware execution
- Middleware caching and memoization for performance optimization
- Security middleware integration with authentication and authorization
- Request/response transformation middleware with data validation
- Performance-optimized middleware execution with zero-allocation patterns
- Pattern-intelligent middleware optimization based on request patterns
- AI-ready hooks for optional intelligent middleware enhancement
- Middleware versioning and hot-swapping for zero-downtime updates
- Custom middleware development framework with standardized interfaces
- Middleware analytics and performance profiling for optimization

Middleware Foundation:
The Aether middleware system provides a high-performance, composable
pipeline architecture with intelligent optimization and AI-ready hooks
while maintaining excellent performance and flexibility for complex
request processing workflows.

Performance First:
Optimized for minimal overhead with efficient context passing,
intelligent middleware ordering, and zero-allocation execution paths
for maximum throughput while providing comprehensive functionality.
