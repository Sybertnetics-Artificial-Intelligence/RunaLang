Aether Core Router with Pattern-Intelligent Routing

This module provides the core routing engine for the Aether web framework including:
- Pattern-based route matching with intelligent optimization
- Dynamic route registration and modification at runtime
- Route parameter extraction with type-safe conversion
- Nested routing with hierarchical path structures
- Route priority management and conflict resolution
- Performance-optimized route lookup with caching strategies
- Middleware integration with route-specific pipeline configuration
- Route versioning and API evolution support
- Pattern-intelligent route optimization based on traffic analysis
- AI-ready hooks for optional intelligent routing enhancement
- Security validation and access control integration
- Route analytics and performance monitoring
- Custom route handler registration and lifecycle management
- RESTful routing conventions with automatic CRUD mapping

Router Foundation:
The Aether router provides a high-performance, pattern-intelligent routing
engine that adapts to traffic patterns while maintaining AI-ready hooks
for optional intelligent enhancements without performance overhead when
advanced features are not utilized.

Performance First:
Optimized with trie-based route matching, intelligent caching, and
zero-allocation path processing for maximum throughput while providing
comprehensive routing features and extensibility.
