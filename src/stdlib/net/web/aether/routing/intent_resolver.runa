Aether Pattern-Based Intent Resolution

This module provides pattern-intelligent intent resolution for the Aether web framework including:
- Pattern-based intent recognition using deterministic algorithms
- Natural language request interpretation with rule-based processing
- Intent-to-handler mapping with confidence scoring and fallback strategies
- Context-aware intent resolution with user behavior pattern analysis
- Multi-language intent support with localization and cultural adaptation
- Intent caching and optimization for frequently encountered patterns
- Intent validation and sanitization for security and data integrity
- Custom intent definition and registration for domain-specific applications
- Performance-optimized intent matching with rule compilation
- AI-ready hooks for optional intelligent intent enhancement
- Intent analytics and pattern learning for continuous improvement
- Fallback routing when intent resolution fails or confidence is low
- Intent versioning and evolution support for API compatibility
- Integration with traditional routing for hybrid routing strategies

Intent Foundation:
The Aether intent resolver uses pattern-based algorithms and rule systems
rather than heavy ML models, providing fast, deterministic intent recognition
with AI-ready hooks for optional intelligent enhancement when needed.

Performance First:
Optimized with compiled rule engines, efficient pattern matching algorithms,
and intelligent caching strategies for maximum throughput while maintaining
accuracy and providing extensibility for complex use cases.
