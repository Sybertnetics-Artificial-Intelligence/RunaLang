Aether Route Pattern Matching and Constraints

This module provides comprehensive route pattern matching and constraint validation including:
- Advanced pattern matching with wildcards, parameters, and regular expressions
- Type-safe parameter extraction with automatic conversion and validation
- Constraint validation with custom rules and business logic integration
- Pattern compilation and optimization for high-performance matching
- Hierarchical pattern matching with nested routes and inheritance
- Pattern caching and memoization for frequently matched patterns
- Dynamic pattern registration and modification at runtime
- Security validation and input sanitization in pattern matching
- Performance monitoring and optimization of pattern matching algorithms
- Pattern-intelligent optimization based on usage frequency and complexity
- AI-ready hooks for optional intelligent pattern enhancement
- Pattern versioning and evolution support for API compatibility
- Custom pattern syntax and domain-specific language support
- Integration with intent resolution for hybrid pattern-intent routing

Pattern Foundation:
The Aether pattern system provides high-performance, type-safe pattern
matching with intelligent optimization and AI-ready hooks while maintaining
deterministic behavior and excellent performance characteristics.

Type-System First:
Leverages Runa's advanced type system for compile-time pattern validation,
automatic type conversion, and type-safe parameter handling that eliminates
runtime errors and provides excellent developer experience.
