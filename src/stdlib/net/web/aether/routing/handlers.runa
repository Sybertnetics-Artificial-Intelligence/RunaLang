Aether Request Handler Registration and Management

This module provides comprehensive request handler registration and management including:
- Handler registration with type-safe parameter binding and validation
- Handler lifecycle management with initialization and cleanup
- Dynamic handler registration and modification at runtime
- Handler performance monitoring and optimization
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms in handler execution
- Handler versioning and backward compatibility support
- Security integration with authentication and authorization validation
- Handler composition and chaining for complex request processing
- Performance-optimized handler execution with caching strategies
- Pattern-intelligent handler optimization based on usage patterns
- AI-ready hooks for optional intelligent handler enhancement
- Handler analytics and profiling for performance optimization
- Custom handler development framework with standardized interfaces
- Integration with middleware pipeline and context management

Handler Foundation:
The Aether handler system provides a high-performance, type-safe
foundation for request processing with intelligent optimization and
AI-ready hooks while maintaining excellent performance and flexibility
for complex application logic.

Type-System First:
Leverages Runa's advanced type system for compile-time handler validation,
automatic parameter binding, and type-safe request/response handling that
eliminates runtime errors and provides excellent developer experience.
