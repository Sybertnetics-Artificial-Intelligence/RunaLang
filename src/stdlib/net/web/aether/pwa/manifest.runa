- Clear validation metrics with actionable manifest optimization insights
- Modular design with composable manifest components and platform-specific adaptations

PWA Manifest Foundation:
Built on structured configuration principles with clear, deterministic
patterns that prioritize standards compliance and developer understanding
while delivering optimal PWA installation and user experience across
diverse platforms with comprehensive customization and optimization capabilities.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for minimal manifest overhead with efficient generation,
intelligent caching, and optimized resource references to ensure
fast PWA installation while maintaining comprehensive feature
declarations and platform compatibility across diverse deployment scenarios.
