UI Component Definitions and Management

This module provides comprehensive component-based UI development
capabilities for the Aether framework, including component lifecycle
management, state handling, event system, and reactive updates for
building modular and reusable user interface elements.

Key Features:
- Component lifecycle management (create, mount, update, unmount)
- State management with reactive updates and change detection
- Event handling system with delegation and propagation
- Props validation and type safety for component interfaces
- Component composition and hierarchical relationships
- Conditional rendering and dynamic component loading
- Performance optimization with virtual DOM diffing
- Component testing and debugging utilities
- Integration with validation and serialization systems
- Server-side and client-side component rendering
- Component library management and versioning
- Custom component creation and registration

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient component system with lifecycle management,
state tracking, and event handling optimized for both server-side
rendering and client-side interactivity in web applications.

Applications:
Essential for building maintainable and scalable user interfaces
with reusable components, proper state management, and efficient
rendering in modern web applications and frameworks.
