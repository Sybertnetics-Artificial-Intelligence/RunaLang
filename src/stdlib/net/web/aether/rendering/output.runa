This module provides comprehensive output generation capabilities for
the Aether rendering system, supporting multiple output formats including
HTML, JSON, XML, YAML, and custom formats with streaming capabilities,
compression, and optimization for various delivery contexts.

Key Features:
- Multi-format output generation (HTML, JSON, XML, YAML, etc.)
- Streaming output support for large datasets and real-time updates
- Content compression and optimization for efficient delivery
- Custom output format registration and plugin architecture
- Content negotiation based on Accept headers and client capabilities
- Server-side rendering with SEO optimization and metadata generation
- Client-side rendering support with hydration capabilities
- Progressive rendering for improved perceived performance
- Output caching and invalidation strategies
- Integration with CDN and edge computing platforms
- Accessibility enhancement and ARIA attribute generation
- Performance monitoring and optimization recommendations

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient output generation with format-specific optimizations,
streaming capabilities, and compression algorithms optimized for web
delivery with support for both server and client environments.

Applications:
Essential for delivering rendered content in various formats to different
clients, supporting modern web delivery patterns, API responses,
and optimized content distribution across diverse platforms.
