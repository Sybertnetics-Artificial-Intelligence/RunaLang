HTML/XML-Like Syntax Parser for Familiar UI Development

This module provides parsing capabilities for familiar HTML/XML-like syntax
in the Aether framework, allowing developers comfortable with traditional
web markup to build user interfaces using familiar patterns while
benefiting from Runa's type safety and performance optimizations.

Key Features:
- HTML/XML-like syntax parsing with familiar tag-based structure
- JSX-like component syntax with embedded expressions
- Template literal support for dynamic content generation
- Attribute validation and type checking with Runa integration
- Namespace support for component libraries and custom elements
- Fragment and conditional rendering support
- Integration with component lifecycle and state management
- Performance-optimized parsing with template caching
- Error reporting with HTML/XML context and suggestions
- Hot reload support for development workflows
- Accessibility attribute validation and enhancement
- Migration tools from existing HTML/XML templates

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient parsing of HTML/XML-like syntax with AST
generation, namespace resolution, and integration with Runa's
type system for familiar yet type-safe UI development.

Applications:
Essential for developers migrating from traditional web frameworks
or those preferring familiar HTML/XML-like syntax while gaining
the benefits of Runa's type safety and performance optimizations.
