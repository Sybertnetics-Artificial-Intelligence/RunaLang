Natural Runa Syntax Parser for UI Development

This module provides parsing capabilities for natural, Runa-native syntax
for UI development, allowing developers to write user interfaces using
clean, readable syntax that follows Runa's language patterns and
conventions while generating efficient rendering code.

Key Features:
- Clean, Runa-native syntax for UI component definition
- Natural language-like constructs for layout and styling
- Type-safe UI element definitions with compile-time checking
- Intuitive property binding and data flow expressions
- Semantic markup generation from natural descriptions
- Integration with Runa's type system for UI validation
- Automatic accessibility attribute generation
- Performance-optimized parsing with syntax caching
- Error reporting with natural language suggestions
- Hot reload support for development workflows
- Integration with component lifecycle and state management
- Extensible syntax rules for domain-specific UI patterns

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient parsing of Runa-native UI syntax with AST
generation, semantic analysis, and code generation optimized
for clean, maintainable UI code that follows Runa conventions.

Applications:
Essential for developers preferring natural, language-like syntax
for UI development, providing an alternative to HTML/XML-like
markup while maintaining full functionality and type safety.
