Core Rendering Engine with Dual-Syntax Support

This module provides the foundational rendering engine for the Aether
framework, supporting both natural Runa syntax and familiar HTML/XML-like
syntax for UI development. The engine provides a pluggable architecture
with transformation hooks and multi-format output capabilities.

Key Features:
- Dual-syntax rendering supporting natural and technical approaches
- Pluggable render pipeline with transformation hooks
- Multi-format output generation (HTML, JSON, XML, etc.)
- Component-based rendering with state management
- Performance-optimized rendering with caching and streaming
- Template compilation and execution engine
- Context-aware rendering with dynamic data binding
- Error handling and debugging support for render operations
- Extensible architecture for custom renderers
- Integration with validation and serialization systems
- Server-side and client-side rendering capabilities
- Progressive rendering for improved user experience

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient rendering algorithms with AST transformation,
template compilation, and output generation optimized for web
applications with support for both server and client environments.

Applications:
Essential for building modern web applications with flexible UI
development approaches, supporting both traditional web developers
and those preferring natural language-like syntax patterns.
