Template Engine Core with Extension Points

This module provides the core template engine for the Aether framework,
featuring template compilation, caching, variable resolution, and
extensible architecture with plugin support for custom functionality
including hooks for AI agent integration at the application level.

Key Features:
- Template compilation and execution with performance optimization
- Variable resolution and scoping with nested context support
- Template caching and invalidation for improved performance
- Plugin architecture for extensible template functionality
- Integration hooks for external processing (AI agents, etc.)
- Template inheritance and composition support
- Error handling and debugging capabilities with detailed diagnostics
- Hot reload support for development workflows
- Template versioning and migration support
- Security features including XSS protection and sandboxing
- Performance monitoring and optimization recommendations
- Multi-format template support with format-specific optimizations

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient template processing with compilation caching,
variable resolution, and extensible hook system designed to integrate
with external services and AI agents at the application level.

Applications:
Essential for building dynamic web applications with flexible templating,
supporting both traditional template processing and modern AI-enhanced
content generation through well-defined extension points.
