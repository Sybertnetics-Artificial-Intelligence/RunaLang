Template Inheritance and Block System

This module provides comprehensive template inheritance capabilities
for the Aether framework, supporting parent-child template relationships,
block definitions and overrides, template composition, and hierarchical
template organization for building maintainable template systems.

Key Features:
- Template inheritance with parent-child relationships
- Block definition and override system for flexible composition
- Template extension with selective content replacement
- Nested inheritance support for complex template hierarchies
- Block parameter passing and context inheritance
- Conditional inheritance based on runtime conditions
- Template mixin support for reusable template components
- Inheritance conflict resolution and validation
- Performance optimization with inheritance caching
- Hot reload support for development workflows
- Template dependency tracking and automatic reloading
- Integration with component system and rendering pipeline

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient template inheritance with block resolution,
context merging, and dependency tracking optimized for web
template systems with complex hierarchical relationships.

Applications:
Essential for building maintainable template systems with shared
layouts, consistent styling, and reusable components while avoiding
code duplication and maintaining template organization.
