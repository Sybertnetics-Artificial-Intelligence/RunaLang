Template Helper Functions and Filters

This module provides comprehensive helper functions and filters for
the Aether templating system, including built-in utilities for string
manipulation, date/time formatting, URL generation, mathematical
operations, and custom helper registration for extensible functionality.

Key Features:
- Built-in string manipulation and formatting functions
- Date and time formatting with locale and timezone support
- URL generation and manipulation utilities
- Mathematical operations and number formatting
- Collection manipulation and iteration helpers
- HTML generation and escaping utilities
- Conditional logic and comparison helpers
- Custom helper registration and plugin architecture
- Performance optimization with helper caching
- Type-safe helper definitions with parameter validation
- Integration with template context and variable resolution
- Localization and internationalization support for helpers

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient helper functions with caching, parameter validation,
and integration with the template execution context optimized for
web template rendering with minimal performance overhead.

Applications:
Essential for building rich templates with data transformation,
formatting capabilities, and reusable logic components while
maintaining clean separation between presentation and data processing.
