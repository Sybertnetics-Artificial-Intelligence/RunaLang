Template Syntax Parser with Aether-Specific Features

This module provides comprehensive template syntax parsing capabilities
for the Aether framework, supporting variable interpolation, control
structures, agent integration hooks, and extensible syntax features
for building powerful and flexible template systems.

Key Features:
- Variable interpolation with {{ variable }} syntax support
- Control structures including if/else, for loops, and switch statements
- Agent hook syntax @[agent.method] for AI integration placeholders
- Template inheritance with block definitions and extends
- Include and partial template support with parameter passing
- Custom filter and function registration for template processing
- Conditional rendering and dynamic content generation
- Template composition with slots and component integration
- Error reporting with precise line and column information
- Syntax highlighting support for development tools
- Hot reload compatibility with incremental parsing
- Performance optimization with syntax caching and compilation

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient template syntax parsing with tokenization,
AST generation, and semantic analysis optimized for template
compilation and execution in web applications.

Applications:
Essential for building dynamic templates with flexible syntax,
supporting both traditional template patterns and modern AI-enhanced
content generation through well-defined syntax extensions.
