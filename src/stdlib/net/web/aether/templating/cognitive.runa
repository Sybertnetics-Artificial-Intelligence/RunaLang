AI Agent Integration Interfaces for Templates

This module provides integration interfaces and protocols for connecting
template rendering with AI agents at the application level. It defines
the communication protocols, data formats, and hook systems that allow
applications to integrate AI agents for dynamic content generation.

IMPORTANT: This module provides INTERFACES and HOOKS only - no actual AI
functionality is implemented here. Applications must provide their own
AI agent implementations and plug them into these interfaces.

Key Features:
- Agent communication protocol definitions for template integration
- Template directive interfaces for agent interaction hooks
- Asynchronous rendering pipeline for external agent calls
- Data serialization protocols for agent communication
- Error handling and fallback strategies for agent failures
- Caching strategies for agent-generated content
- Request/response validation for agent interactions
- Performance monitoring for agent integration overhead
- Security features for safe agent communication
- Agent capability discovery and negotiation
- Template context sharing protocols with agents
- Integration hooks for real-time content personalization

Technical Foundation:
Implements communication protocols and interfaces that applications
can use to integrate AI agents with template rendering, providing
structured ways to enhance templates with AI-generated content.

Applications:
Essential for applications wanting to integrate AI agents for dynamic
content generation, personalization, and intelligent template processing
while maintaining clear separation between stdlib and AI implementations.
