- Localization support with multi-language documentation and internationalization
- Development workflow integration with CI/CD pipeline automation and validation
- Standards compliance with OpenAPI specification and industry best practices

Key Features:
- AI-friendly design with declarative OpenAPI patterns that are easily understood
- Type-safe specification generation using Runa's type system for automatic validation
- Semantic API documentation with intention-revealing operation descriptions
- Self-updating specifications with automatic regeneration from type changes
- Pattern-based organization with consistent specification structure and standards
- Integration-ready architecture with hooks for custom documentation and validation
- Clear specification metrics with actionable OpenAPI optimization insights
- Standards-compliant implementation with OpenAPI 3.0+ specification adherence

OpenAPI Foundation:
Built on type-driven specification principles with clear, deterministic
patterns that prioritize API documentation accuracy and developer
understanding while delivering comprehensive OpenAPI specifications
with automatic generation and validation capabilities across diverse API types.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient specification generation with intelligent schema
optimization, reference management, and documentation caching to ensure
fast specification updates while maintaining comprehensive API
documentation and validation coverage across complex API architectures.
