GraphQL Foundation:
Built on type-first GraphQL principles with clear, deterministic patterns
that prioritize developer understanding and type safety while delivering
high-performance GraphQL APIs with comprehensive feature coverage and
standards compliance across diverse application domains and data sources.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient query execution with intelligent data fetching,
advanced caching strategies, and query optimization to ensure fast
GraphQL responses while maintaining type safety and comprehensive
feature coverage across complex query patterns and data relationships.
