- Standards-compliant REST implementation with modern API best practices

REST API Foundation:
Built on semantic resource management principles with clear, intention-revealing
patterns that prioritize developer understanding and API consistency while
delivering high-performance REST APIs with comprehensive feature coverage
and standards compliance across diverse application domains.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-throughput API serving with efficient request processing,
intelligent caching, and minimal overhead to ensure fast API responses while
maintaining comprehensive feature coverage and type safety across diverse
API usage patterns and client requirements.
