API Documentation Foundation:
Built on template-driven generation principles with clear, deterministic
patterns that prioritize documentation accuracy and developer experience
while delivering comprehensive API documentation with automatic
generation and validation capabilities across diverse API architectures.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient documentation generation with intelligent template
processing, optimized rendering, and comprehensive caching to ensure
fast documentation updates while maintaining comprehensive coverage
and high-quality presentation across diverse documentation formats.
