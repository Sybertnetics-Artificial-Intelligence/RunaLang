Key Features:
- AI-friendly design with semantic routing patterns that are easily understood
- Type-safe configuration using Runa's advanced type system for validation
- Declarative caching policies with clear intent and performance characteristics
- Integration-ready architecture with hooks for external optimization services
- Self-documenting APIs with intention-revealing names and structured patterns
- Pattern-based request handling with deterministic routing and response logic
- Clear separation of concerns with modular components and clean interfaces
- Performance-optimized serving with minimal overhead and efficient resource usage

Static Serving Foundation:
Built on semantic web principles with clear, intention-revealing patterns
that prioritize developer understanding and AI tool compatibility while
delivering high-performance static asset serving with comprehensive
security and optimization features across diverse deployment environments.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-throughput static serving with efficient memory usage,
intelligent caching strategies, and minimal CPU overhead to ensure fast
content delivery while maintaining clear code patterns and comprehensive
feature coverage for modern web application asset serving requirements.
