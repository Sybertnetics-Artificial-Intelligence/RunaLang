- Configuration service mocking with environment-specific behavior
- Logging service mocking with structured log capture and analysis
- Monitoring service mocking with metrics collection and alerting simulation
- Payment service mocking with transaction processing and webhook simulation
- Email service mocking with SMTP behavior and template rendering
- Search service mocking with indexing and query result simulation
- Notification service mocking with multi-channel delivery simulation
- Analytics service mocking with event tracking and reporting simulation
- Content delivery mocking with CDN behavior and edge cache simulation
- Security service mocking with vulnerability scanning and threat detection
- Backup service mocking with data replication and recovery simulation

Key Features:
- Realistic service behavior simulation with configurable response patterns
- Request and response validation with schema enforcement
- State management with persistent mock data across test scenarios
- Error injection with realistic failure patterns and recovery testing
- Performance simulation with configurable latency and throughput
- Contract testing with API specification validation and compatibility
- Multi-environment mocking with environment-specific behavior patterns
- Integration testing support with service dependency simulation

Mock Foundation:
Built on flexible mocking architecture that supports complex service
interactions, realistic behavior patterns, and comprehensive validation
to enable thorough testing of web applications with reliable service
simulation and dependency isolation for consistent test execution.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient mock service execution with minimal overhead,
intelligent state management, and resource cleanup to ensure fast
test execution while maintaining realistic service behavior and
comprehensive validation coverage across all mocked dependencies.
