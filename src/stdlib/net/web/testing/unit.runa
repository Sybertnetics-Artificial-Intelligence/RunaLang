Web Component Unit Testing Framework

This module provides comprehensive unit testing functionality for web components including:
- Component isolation and mocking with dependency injection support
- DOM manipulation testing with virtual DOM and snapshot capabilities
- Event handling testing with comprehensive event simulation and validation
- State management testing with state transitions and side effect validation
- Component lifecycle testing with mount, update, and unmount verification
- Props and attribute testing with type validation and edge case coverage
- Rendering output testing with HTML/CSS validation and accessibility checks
- Asynchronous operation testing with Promise/async-await pattern support
- Custom hook testing with hook isolation and state verification
- Component integration testing with parent-child relationship validation
- Performance testing with rendering time and memory usage measurement
- Cross-browser compatibility testing with browser-specific behavior validation
- Test data generation and fixture management for realistic test scenarios
- Test coverage analysis and reporting with comprehensive metrics
- Debugging utilities and test failure analysis with detailed error reporting

Key Features:
- Isolated component testing with comprehensive mocking capabilities
- Virtual DOM testing with snapshot comparison and diff analysis
- Event simulation and validation with comprehensive event type support
- State management testing with time-travel debugging and state inspection
- Lifecycle testing with detailed hook and method call verification
- Performance profiling and optimization recommendations for components
- Accessibility testing integration with ARIA and keyboard navigation validation
- Test parallelization and optimization for large test suites

Testing Foundation:
Built on modern testing methodologies with support for component isolation,
comprehensive mocking, and detailed assertion capabilities. Provides
robust testing infrastructure for React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla
JavaScript components with cross-framework compatibility.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for fast test execution with parallel test running, intelligent
test caching, and minimal setup overhead. Includes performance profiling
tools to identify and optimize slow-running tests and component bottlenecks.
