Web Accessibility Testing and WCAG Compliance Framework

This module provides comprehensive web accessibility testing functionality including:
- WCAG 2.1 compliance testing with Level A, AA, and AAA validation
- Screen reader compatibility testing with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver simulation
- Keyboard navigation testing with complete keyboard accessibility validation
- Color contrast analysis with WCAG contrast ratio requirements validation
- Focus management testing with logical focus order and visual focus indicators
- ARIA attribute validation with semantic markup and accessibility tree analysis
- Alternative text validation for images, media, and interactive elements
- Form accessibility testing with proper labeling and error handling validation
- Heading structure analysis with logical hierarchy and navigation validation
- Skip link testing with keyboard navigation shortcuts and content bypass validation
- Table accessibility testing with proper header associations and data relationships
- Landmark and region testing with semantic page structure and navigation aids
- Live region testing with dynamic content updates and screen reader announcements
- Document structure testing with semantic HTML and accessibility compliance
- Mobile accessibility testing with touch target sizing and gesture alternatives

Key Features:
- Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 compliance validation across all success criteria
- Automated accessibility scanning with detailed violation reporting
- Screen reader simulation with realistic assistive technology behavior
- Keyboard navigation validation with complete interaction testing
- Color accessibility analysis with colorblind simulation and contrast validation
- ARIA implementation testing with accessibility tree verification
- Accessibility testing integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous compliance
- Multi-device accessibility testing including mobile and assistive technology

Accessibility Foundation:
Built on industry-standard accessibility guidelines and testing methodologies,
providing comprehensive validation against WCAG, Section 508, and ADA
compliance requirements. Ensures inclusive web experiences for users
with disabilities through thorough automated and manual testing approaches.

Testing Considerations:
Designed to provide actionable accessibility insights with detailed
remediation guidance, prioritized issue reporting, and integration
with development workflows to ensure accessibility is maintained
throughout the development lifecycle and deployment process.
