Web Integration Testing and API Testing Framework

This module provides comprehensive integration testing functionality including:
- API endpoint testing with comprehensive HTTP method and status code validation
- Service integration testing with multi-service communication validation
- Database integration testing with transaction management and data validation
- Authentication and authorization integration testing with token and session validation
- Third-party service integration testing with external API and webhook validation
- Microservice communication testing with service mesh and discovery validation
- Real-time communication testing with WebSocket and SSE integration validation
- File upload and download integration testing with multipart data validation
- Cache integration testing with Redis, Memcached, and distributed cache validation
- Message queue integration testing with pub/sub and event-driven architecture
- Configuration and environment integration testing with multi-environment validation
- Cross-service transaction testing with distributed transaction and rollback validation
- API contract testing with schema validation and backward compatibility checks
- Performance integration testing with load simulation and bottleneck identification
- Security integration testing with penetration testing and vulnerability assessment

Key Features:
- Comprehensive API testing with REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket support
- Multi-service integration validation with dependency management
- Database transaction testing with rollback and consistency validation
- Authentication flow testing with OAuth, JWT, and session-based validation
- Real-time communication testing with event simulation and validation
- Contract testing with OpenAPI and GraphQL schema validation
- Performance testing integration with load and stress testing capabilities
- Security testing integration with OWASP compliance and vulnerability scanning

Integration Foundation:
Built on robust testing infrastructure that supports complex multi-service
architectures, providing comprehensive validation of service interactions,
data flow, and system behavior across distributed systems with realistic
test scenarios and production-like environments.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient test execution with intelligent test ordering,
parallel execution, and resource management to minimize test runtime
while maintaining comprehensive validation coverage across all
integration points and system boundaries.
