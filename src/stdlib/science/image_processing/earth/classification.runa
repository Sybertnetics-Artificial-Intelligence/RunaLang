Land Cover and Land Use Classification

This module provides comprehensive land cover and land use classification
algorithms for Earth observation data including supervised and unsupervised
classification methods, object-based image analysis, machine learning
approaches, and accuracy assessment techniques. Supports multi-temporal
and multi-sensor classification for detailed land cover mapping.

Key Features:
- Supervised classification using maximum likelihood, SVM, and neural networks
- Unsupervised classification with k-means, ISODATA, and hierarchical clustering
- Object-based image analysis for high-resolution imagery
- Multi-temporal classification for improved accuracy
- Feature extraction and selection for optimal classification
- Ensemble methods combining multiple classifiers
- Active learning and semi-supervised approaches
- Contextual and spatial-spectral classification
- Hierarchical classification schemes
- Comprehensive accuracy assessment and validation

Classification Principles:
Land cover classification assigns pixels or image objects to thematic
categories based on spectral, spatial, temporal, and contextual information.
Different approaches exploit various aspects of the data including spectral
signatures, spatial patterns, temporal trajectories, and contextual
relationships to discriminate between land cover classes.

Machine Learning Integration:
Modern classification approaches integrate machine learning algorithms
including support vector machines, random forests, neural networks, and
deep learning methods. These techniques can handle complex, non-linear
relationships in high-dimensional feature spaces and provide robust
classification results for diverse Earth observation applications.

Applications:
Applications include natural resource management, environmental monitoring,
urban planning, agriculture assessment, ecosystem mapping, climate studies,
and land change analysis. Accurate classification provides essential
information for understanding Earth system processes and supporting
decision-making for sustainable development.
