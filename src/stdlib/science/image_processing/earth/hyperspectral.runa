Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Analysis and Spectral Processing

This module provides comprehensive hyperspectral image processing capabilities
including spectral unmixing, endmember extraction, target detection, and
material identification. Supports airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral sensors
with hundreds of contiguous spectral bands for detailed spectral analysis
and advanced Earth observation applications.

Key Features:
- Spectral unmixing using linear and nonlinear models
- Endmember extraction and spectral library management
- Target detection and material identification algorithms  
- Dimensionality reduction and feature selection techniques
- Spectral angle mapping and similarity measurements
- Anomaly detection in hyperspectral data cubes
- Atmospheric correction specialized for hyperspectral data
- Noise reduction and bad band removal
- Classification using spectral and spatial information
- Integration with spectral libraries and databases

Hyperspectral Principles:
Hyperspectral imaging collects data in hundreds of narrow, contiguous
spectral bands enabling detailed spectral characterization of materials.
Each pixel contains a complete spectrum that can be analyzed for material
composition, chemical properties, and physical characteristics based on
diagnostic absorption features and spectral signatures.

Processing Challenges:
Hyperspectral data presents unique challenges including high dimensionality,
spectral correlation, noise effects, atmospheric contamination, and
computational complexity. Processing algorithms must handle the curse of
dimensionality while preserving spectral fidelity and extracting meaningful
information from detailed spectral signatures.

Applications:
Applications include geology and mineral exploration, precision agriculture,
environmental monitoring, urban studies, forestry, water quality assessment,
military surveillance, and industrial monitoring. Hyperspectral analysis
enables detailed material characterization impossible with multispectral
sensors alone.
