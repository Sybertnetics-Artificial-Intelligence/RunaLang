Satellite and Remote Sensing Image Processing

This module provides comprehensive satellite image processing capabilities for
Earth observation including geometric correction, radiometric calibration,
atmospheric correction, and multi-temporal analysis. Supports major satellite
platforms including Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, and commercial high-resolution
sensors for environmental monitoring and land cover analysis.

Key Features:
- Geometric correction and orthorectification using DEMs
- Radiometric calibration and conversion to physical units
- Atmospheric correction using radiative transfer models
- Pan-sharpening and image fusion techniques
- Multi-temporal analysis and change detection
- Cloud detection and masking algorithms
- Mosaic creation with seamline optimization
- Topographic correction for terrain effects
- Water body extraction and coastal zone analysis
- Integration with geographic information systems (GIS)

Remote Sensing Principles:
Satellite remote sensing measures electromagnetic radiation reflected or
emitted from Earth's surface across multiple spectral bands. Different
materials exhibit characteristic spectral signatures enabling classification
and monitoring applications. Processing algorithms must account for
atmospheric effects, sensor characteristics, and geometric distortions.

Sensor Considerations:
Different satellite sensors have unique characteristics including spatial
resolution, spectral bands, temporal revisit, and radiometric accuracy.
Processing workflows must be adapted for sensor-specific calibration
parameters, geometric models, and data formats while maintaining
consistency across different platforms.

Applications:
Applications include land cover mapping, environmental monitoring, urban
planning, agriculture assessment, disaster response, climate studies,
and natural resource management. Satellite data provides synoptic coverage
and systematic monitoring capabilities essential for Earth system science.
