DICOM File Format Processing and Medical Image Standards

This module provides comprehensive DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)
file format handling including parsing, metadata extraction, patient data management,
and PACS integration. Implements DICOM standard compliance for medical imaging workflows
with proper handling of multi-frame, multi-modality data and network communications.

Key Features:
- Complete DICOM file parsing with tag dictionary support
- Patient data anonymization and de-identification workflows
- Series and study organization with hierarchical metadata
- Multi-frame and cine-loop processing for dynamic imaging
- DICOM networking for PACS, DICOM-SR, and worklist management
- Pixel data extraction with proper photometric interpretation
- Transfer syntax handling (compressed and uncompressed formats)
- DICOM conformance validation and error reporting
- Integration with medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI, US, CR, DR)
- Structured reporting and presentation state management

Medical Imaging Context:
DICOM is the international standard for medical images and related information.
It defines formats for medical images that can be exchanged with accompanying
data including patient information, imaging parameters, and clinical context.
The standard ensures interoperability between medical imaging equipment from
different manufacturers and healthcare information systems.

DICOM Data Model:
Information objects are organized hierarchically: Patient > Study > Series > Instance.
Each level contains specific attributes relevant to that organizational level.
Data elements are identified by group/element tags and include value representation,
value length, and data field components for structured information exchange.

Privacy and Security:
Medical data requires strict privacy protection under HIPAA and international
regulations. De-identification processes must remove or modify protected health
information (PHI) while preserving clinical utility of imaging data.
