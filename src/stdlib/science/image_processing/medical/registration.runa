Medical Image Registration and Spatial Alignment

This module provides comprehensive medical image registration algorithms for
spatial alignment of images from different time points, modalities, or subjects.
Implements both rigid and non-rigid registration methods with robust optimization
techniques and quality assessment for clinical applications.

Key Features:
- Rigid registration for translation and rotation alignment
- Affine registration including scaling and shearing transformations  
- Non-rigid registration using B-splines, demons, and optical flow
- Multi-modal registration (CT-MRI, PET-CT, T1-T2) with appropriate metrics
- Longitudinal registration for disease progression monitoring
- Atlas registration for population studies and normalization
- Real-time registration for image-guided interventions
- Landmark-based and intensity-based registration methods
- Robust optimization with multi-resolution and regularization
- Validation metrics and transformation quality assessment

Registration Applications:
Medical image registration enables temporal comparison, multi-modal fusion,
population studies, treatment planning, and image-guided surgery. Applications
include monitoring tumor growth, aligning functional and anatomical images,
creating statistical atlases, planning radiotherapy treatments, and providing
real-time guidance during minimally invasive procedures.

Mathematical Framework:
Registration optimizes a similarity metric between fixed and moving images
by searching for optimal transformation parameters. The process involves
interpolation for coordinate transformation, similarity metric computation,
and iterative optimization using gradient descent or evolutionary algorithms
with appropriate regularization to ensure realistic deformations.

Clinical Considerations:
Registration accuracy directly impacts clinical decision-making. Algorithms
must handle patient motion, anatomical changes, contrast variations, and
imaging artifacts while maintaining computational efficiency for clinical
workflows. Validation against expert landmarks and clinical outcomes ensures
registration quality meets diagnostic requirements.
