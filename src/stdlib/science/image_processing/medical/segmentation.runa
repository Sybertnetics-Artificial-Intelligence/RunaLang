Medical Image Segmentation and Anatomical Structure Analysis

This module provides comprehensive medical image segmentation algorithms for
anatomical structure identification, tumor detection, and tissue classification.
Implements both traditional image processing methods and modern machine learning
approaches with validation metrics and clinical workflow integration.

Key Features:
- Anatomical structure segmentation (organs, vessels, bones)
- Tumor detection and delineation with uncertainty quantification
- Multi-modal segmentation combining CT, MRI, PET data
- Atlas-based segmentation using statistical shape models
- Deep learning segmentation with pre-trained clinical models
- Semi-automatic segmentation with user interaction and correction
- Hierarchical segmentation from coarse to fine anatomical levels
- Temporal segmentation for dynamic and functional imaging
- Quality assessment and validation against expert annotations
- Integration with radiotherapy treatment planning systems

Segmentation Approaches:
Medical image segmentation combines intensity-based methods, shape priors,
spatial context, and domain knowledge. Traditional approaches include
thresholding, region growing, level sets, and graph cuts. Modern methods
leverage deep learning architectures like U-Net, V-Net, and attention
mechanisms trained on large annotated medical datasets.

Clinical Applications:
Accurate segmentation enables quantitative analysis for diagnosis, treatment
planning, surgical guidance, and disease monitoring. Applications include
tumor volume measurement, organ dose calculation for radiotherapy,
surgical planning with 3D models, and longitudinal disease progression
assessment through automated measurements.

Validation and Quality Control:
Medical segmentation requires rigorous validation using metrics like Dice
coefficient, Hausdorff distance, surface distance, and volumetric overlap.
Clinical validation involves expert review, inter-observer variability
analysis, and correlation with clinical outcomes to ensure diagnostic utility.
