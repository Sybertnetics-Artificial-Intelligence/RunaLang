Medical Image Reconstruction Algorithms

This module provides comprehensive medical image reconstruction algorithms for
computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission
tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
Implements both analytical and iterative reconstruction methods with advanced
artifact reduction and noise filtering techniques.

Key Features:
- CT reconstruction using filtered backprojection and cone-beam algorithms
- MRI reconstruction from k-space data with parallel imaging support
- PET/SPECT reconstruction with attenuation and scatter correction
- Iterative reconstruction methods (OSEM, MLEM, algebraic techniques)
- Multi-planar reformation (MPR) and 3D volume rendering
- Advanced artifact reduction (beam hardening, metal artifacts, motion)
- Noise reduction and image enhancement algorithms
- GPU-accelerated reconstruction for real-time processing
- Quality assessment and validation metrics
- Integration with scanner-specific data formats

Reconstruction Theory:
Medical image reconstruction involves recovering cross-sectional images from
projection data acquired by various imaging modalities. CT uses X-ray projections,
MRI uses radiofrequency signals in magnetic field gradients, while nuclear
medicine techniques use gamma ray emissions. Each modality requires specialized
mathematical approaches to transform acquired data into diagnostic images.

Mathematical Foundations:
Reconstruction is fundamentally based on inverse problem solving, often involving
Radon transform inversion for CT, Fourier transform relationships for MRI,
and statistical estimation for emission tomography. Iterative methods model
the forward imaging process and optimize image estimates through likelihood
maximization or algebraic constraint satisfaction.

Clinical Considerations:
Reconstruction parameters significantly impact diagnostic image quality,
radiation dose (for CT), acquisition time, and motion sensitivity.
Modern techniques balance spatial resolution, contrast resolution, noise
characteristics, and computational efficiency for optimal clinical utility.
