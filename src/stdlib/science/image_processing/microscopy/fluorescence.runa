Fluorescence Microscopy Image Processing and Analysis

This module provides comprehensive fluorescence microscopy image processing
including multi-channel analysis, quantitative measurements, colocalization
studies, and advanced deconvolution techniques. Supports wide-field, confocal,
and super-resolution fluorescence imaging workflows with proper handling of
photobleaching, autofluorescence, and spectral bleed-through artifacts.

Key Features:
- Multi-channel fluorescence image processing and analysis
- Background subtraction and flat-field correction
- Photobleaching correction and intensity normalization
- Spectral unmixing and bleed-through compensation
- Colocalization analysis with statistical validation
- FRET (FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer) analysis and efficiency calculation
- FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) kinetic analysis
- Deconvolution for improved resolution and contrast
- Particle tracking and dynamics analysis
- Quantitative intensity measurements and calibration

Fluorescence Imaging Principles:
Fluorescence microscopy relies on fluorophore excitation and emission
characteristics to provide molecular specificity and sensitivity.
Multi-channel imaging enables simultaneous visualization of different
cellular components, while quantitative analysis requires careful
consideration of imaging parameters, optical setup, and potential artifacts.

Photophysics Considerations:
Fluorophore behavior includes excitation/emission spectra, quantum yield,
photostability, and environmental sensitivity. Processing algorithms must
account for photobleaching kinetics, pH sensitivity, ion concentration
effects, and temperature dependence for accurate quantitative analysis.

Clinical and Research Applications:
Applications include cell biology research, drug discovery, diagnostics,
pathology, developmental biology, and neuroscience studies. Quantitative
fluorescence analysis enables protein localization, molecular interactions,
cellular dynamics, and therapeutic response assessment.
