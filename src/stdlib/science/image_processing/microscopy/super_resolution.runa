Super-Resolution Microscopy Image Processing and Analysis

This module provides comprehensive super-resolution microscopy image processing
for STORM (Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy), PALM (Photo-Activated
Localization Microscopy), STED (Stimulated Emission Depletion), and structured
illumination microscopy (SIM). Implements advanced algorithms for single molecule
localization, image reconstruction, and quantitative nanoscale analysis.

Key Features:
- Single molecule localization with sub-pixel precision
- STORM/PALM reconstruction from localization coordinates
- Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) reconstruction
- STED image processing and deconvolution
- Drift correction and fiducial marker tracking
- Clustering analysis and spatial organization quantification
- Resolution assessment and validation metrics
- Multi-color super-resolution registration and colocalization
- Live-cell super-resolution processing and temporal analysis
- Integration with conventional microscopy for correlative imaging

Super-Resolution Principles:
Super-resolution microscopy overcomes the diffraction limit through various
approaches: single molecule localization (STORM/PALM), depletion of excited
states (STED), or structured illumination (SIM). These techniques achieve
10-50 nm resolution compared to ~250 nm for conventional fluorescence
microscopy, enabling nanoscale structural and functional analysis.

Technical Challenges:
Processing super-resolution data requires specialized algorithms for precise
localization, artifact correction, reconstruction optimization, and validation.
Key challenges include photon noise, labeling density, drift correction,
chromatic aberrations, and quantitative analysis at the nanoscale level
with proper statistical validation.

Biological Applications:
Applications include protein complex organization, membrane structure analysis,
cytoskeletal architecture, organelle interactions, viral replication sites,
synaptic organization, and single molecule dynamics. Quantitative analysis
enables measurements of protein clustering, spatial organization, and
molecular stoichiometry at unprecedented resolution.
