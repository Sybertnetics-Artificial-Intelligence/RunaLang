Electron Microscopy Image Processing and Analysis

This module provides comprehensive electron microscopy image processing for
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Implements specialized algorithms for
high-resolution structural analysis, tomographic reconstruction, single particle
analysis, and automated feature detection in electron microscopy data.

Key Features:
- TEM and SEM image enhancement and artifact correction
- Cryo-EM single particle analysis and 3D reconstruction
- Electron tomography with tilt series alignment and reconstruction
- Contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation and correction
- Particle picking and classification algorithms
- High-resolution structural refinement and validation
- Dose-weighted processing for radiation damage correction
- Automated image quality assessment and selection
- Crystal structure analysis and diffraction pattern processing
- 3D visualization and molecular modeling integration

Electron Microscopy Principles:
Electron microscopy uses accelerated electrons instead of light to achieve
sub-nanometer resolution. TEM provides internal structure information
through transmitted electrons, while SEM images surface topography using
secondary or backscattered electrons. Cryo-EM preserves native structures
in near-physiological conditions for biological specimens.

Image Formation and Artifacts:
Electron-specimen interactions create contrast through amplitude and phase
modulation. Common artifacts include drift, charging, radiation damage,
curtaining effects, and optical aberrations. Processing algorithms must
account for the contrast transfer function, dose fractionation, and
beam-induced motion for optimal image quality.

Applications:
Applications span materials science, biology, nanotechnology, and quality
control. Cryo-EM enables atomic-resolution protein structure determination,
cellular tomography, and drug discovery. Materials analysis includes
defect characterization, phase identification, and nanostructure analysis.
