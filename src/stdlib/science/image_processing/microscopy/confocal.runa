Confocal Microscopy Image Processing and 3D Analysis

This module provides comprehensive confocal microscopy image processing including
Z-stack analysis, optical sectioning optimization, 3D visualization, and
quantitative volume measurements. Supports laser scanning confocal, spinning
disk confocal, and light-sheet microscopy with advanced deconvolution and
multi-dimensional analysis capabilities.

Key Features:
- Z-stack processing and 3D volume reconstruction
- Maximum intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendering
- Optical sectioning and point spread function modeling
- 3D deconvolution for improved resolution and contrast
- Time-lapse analysis and 4D (space-time) processing
- Multi-channel 3D colocalization analysis
- Quantitative 3D morphometry and volume measurements
- Surface rendering and mesh generation from 3D data
- Drift correction for long-term time-lapse experiments
- Integration with fluorescence quantification workflows

Confocal Imaging Principles:
Confocal microscopy uses point illumination and pinhole detection to
achieve optical sectioning by rejecting out-of-focus light. This enables
3D imaging of thick specimens with improved axial resolution compared to
wide-field microscopy. The technique produces image stacks representing
optical sections through the specimen volume.

3D Image Processing Challenges:
Confocal 3D datasets present unique challenges including anisotropic
resolution (typically lower in Z than XY), photobleaching during
acquisition, specimen drift, and large data volumes. Processing algorithms
must handle these characteristics while preserving spatial relationships
and enabling accurate quantitative measurements.

Applications:
Applications include cell biology, developmental biology, neuroscience,
materials science, and clinical diagnostics. 3D confocal imaging enables
analysis of cellular architecture, organelle distribution, protein
localization, tissue organization, and dynamic processes in living cells.
