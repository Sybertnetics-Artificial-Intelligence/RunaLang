Large-Scale Astronomical Survey Data Processing

This module provides comprehensive capabilities for processing large astronomical
survey datasets including sky tessellation, catalog management, statistical
analysis, and cross-matching algorithms. Implements scalable data processing
pipelines for modern wide-field surveys with billions of sources and
multi-wavelength, multi-epoch observations.

Key Features:
- Large dataset handling with efficient indexing and querying
- Sky tessellation using HEALPix, HTM, and other hierarchical schemes
- Multi-catalog cross-matching with probabilistic association
- Statistical analysis of survey completeness and selection functions
- Time-domain analysis for variable and transient object detection
- Multi-wavelength SED fitting and photometric redshift estimation
- Large-scale structure analysis and clustering measurements
- Survey planning and observing strategy optimization
- Data quality assessment and systematic error characterization
- Integration with major survey databases and virtual observatories

Survey Science Context:
Modern astronomical surveys map large fractions of the sky to unprecedented
depth and precision, discovering billions of sources across multiple
wavelengths and epochs. Processing these datasets requires sophisticated
algorithms for data reduction, source detection, photometry, astrometry,
and statistical analysis to extract astrophysical insights.

Computational Challenges:
Survey data processing involves massive datasets requiring distributed
computing, efficient algorithms, and careful memory management.
Statistical analyses must account for selection biases, systematic
errors, and incomplete sampling while maintaining computational
efficiency for billion-source catalogs.

Scientific Applications:
Applications include cosmological parameter estimation, galaxy evolution
studies, stellar astronomy, dark matter mapping, supernova cosmology,
exoplanet detection, asteroid discovery, and time-domain astronomy.
Survey data enables population studies and statistical investigations
impossible with smaller samples.
