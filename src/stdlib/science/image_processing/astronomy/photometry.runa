Astronomical Photometry and Brightness Measurements

This module provides comprehensive astronomical photometry capabilities including
aperture photometry, PSF photometry, differential photometry, and photometric
calibration. Implements advanced algorithms for stellar brightness measurements,
magnitude calculations, light curve analysis, and photometric redshift estimation
for astronomical research and survey data processing.

Key Features:
- Aperture photometry with background subtraction and error analysis
- PSF photometry for crowded field stellar measurements
- Differential photometry for high-precision relative measurements
- Photometric calibration using standard stars and synthetic photometry
- Light curve extraction and period analysis for variable stars
- Color index calculations and stellar classification
- Photometric redshift estimation for galaxies
- Survey photometry with automated quality assessment
- Multi-band photometry and SED fitting
- Integration with astronomical catalogs and coordinate systems

Photometric Principles:
Astronomical photometry measures the brightness of celestial objects across
different wavelength bands. Standard systems include Johnson-Cousins UBVRI,
Sloan Digital Sky Survey ugriz, and infrared systems. Measurements require
careful calibration, atmospheric extinction correction, and systematic
error analysis to achieve scientific precision.

Observational Considerations:
Photometric accuracy depends on atmospheric conditions, instrumental stability,
detector characteristics, and observing strategy. Processing algorithms must
account for atmospheric extinction, airmass effects, color transformations,
aperture corrections, and contamination from nearby sources.

Scientific Applications:
Applications include stellar astronomy, galaxy studies, cosmology, exoplanet
detection, supernova surveys, asteroid tracking, and time-domain astronomy.
Precision photometry enables studies of stellar variability, galaxy evolution,
dark energy constraints, and transient object discovery and characterization.
