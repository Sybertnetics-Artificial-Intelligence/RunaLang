Astrometric Measurements and Coordinate Systems

This module provides comprehensive astrometric analysis capabilities including
world coordinate system (WCS) handling, plate solving, proper motion measurement,
parallax determination, and celestial coordinate transformations. Implements
precision astrometry algorithms for stellar positions, spacecraft navigation,
and astronomical survey data processing.

Key Features:
- World Coordinate System (WCS) creation and transformation
- Plate solving and field identification from stellar patterns
- Proper motion measurement and stellar kinematics analysis
- Parallax determination and distance measurements
- Coordinate system transformations (equatorial, galactic, ecliptic)
- Distortion correction and optical field modeling
- Reference catalog matching and astrometric calibration
- Time-dependent coordinate corrections (precession, nutation, aberration)
- Asteroid and comet tracking with orbital parameter estimation
- Integration with major astrometric catalogs (Gaia, HIPPARCOS, USNO)

Astrometric Principles:
Astrometry measures precise positions and motions of celestial objects.
Modern astrometry relies on differential measurements relative to reference
stars with known positions, typically using CCD imaging and stellar catalogs.
Precision astrometry requires careful modeling of optical distortions,
atmospheric refraction, and systematic instrumental effects.

Coordinate Systems:
Standard astronomical coordinate systems include equatorial (RA/Dec), galactic,
and ecliptic coordinates. Time-dependent corrections account for Earth's motion,
precession of equinoxes, nutation, and relativistic effects. Proper coordinate
handling is essential for accurate astrometric analysis and catalog compilation.

Applications:
Applications include stellar astronomy, solar system studies, spacecraft
navigation, exoplanet detection, gravitational lensing, fundamental physics
tests, and astronomical survey operations. High-precision astrometry enables
studies of stellar kinematics, galaxy structure, and tests of general relativity.
