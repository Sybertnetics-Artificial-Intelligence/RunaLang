Astronomical Spectroscopy and Spectral Analysis

This module provides comprehensive astronomical spectroscopy capabilities including
spectral extraction, wavelength calibration, continuum normalization, spectral
line analysis, and redshift measurement. Implements advanced algorithms for
both low and high-resolution spectroscopy across optical, infrared, and
ultraviolet wavelength ranges for stellar and extragalactic astronomy.

Key Features:
- 1D and 2D spectral extraction with optimal weighting algorithms
- Wavelength calibration using arc lamp and telluric line references
- Flux calibration with standard star observations
- Continuum fitting and normalization techniques
- Spectral line identification, fitting, and equivalent width measurement
- Redshift determination using cross-correlation and template matching
- Stellar parameter determination (temperature, gravity, metallicity)
- Interstellar medium analysis and extinction correction
- Spectral classification and stellar atmosphere modeling
- Integration with major spectroscopic surveys and databases

Spectroscopic Principles:
Astronomical spectroscopy disperses starlight into component wavelengths,
revealing absorption and emission lines that encode physical conditions
in stellar atmospheres, interstellar medium, and distant galaxies.
Line profiles provide information about temperature, pressure, composition,
magnetic fields, and bulk motion of astronomical objects.

Technical Challenges:
Processing spectroscopic data requires careful handling of instrumental
effects including wavelength-dependent response, scattered light,
fringing, telluric contamination, and systematic calibration errors.
High-resolution spectroscopy demands precise wavelength solutions
and sophisticated line profile analysis techniques.

Scientific Applications:
Applications include stellar astrophysics, galactic astronomy, cosmology,
exoplanet detection, interstellar medium studies, and active galactic
nuclei research. Spectroscopy enables measurements of stellar properties,
chemical abundances, kinematics, magnetic fields, and cosmological parameters.
