Physical Constants and Universal Values

This module provides comprehensive access to fundamental physical constants
with proper units, uncertainties, and precision control. All constants follow
CODATA (Committee on Data for Science and Technology) recommended values with
appropriate uncertainty estimates and version tracking.

Key Features:
- Universal fundamental constants (c, h, ℏ, k_B, N_A, G, e, m_e, m_p, etc.)
- CODATA 2018/2022 recommended values with documented uncertainties
- Unit system conversions between SI, CGS, Gaussian, and natural units
- Precision tracking and significant figure management
- Derived constants calculation with error propagation
- Temperature, pressure, and reference condition constants
- Mathematical constants used in physics (π, e, γ, ζ functions)
- Atomic and nuclear constants with isotope-specific values
- Electromagnetic constants and coupling strengths
- Cosmological constants and astronomical reference values

Physical Foundation:
Constants are organized by physical domain and provide both exact values
(like c, h) defined by SI base units and measured values (like G, α)
with experimental uncertainties. All values include proper dimensional
analysis and conversion factors between unit systems.

Reference Standards:
Values follow CODATA 2018 adjustment unless otherwise specified, with
provision for historical values and competing measurements. Each constant
includes provenance, measurement method, and uncertainty classification.
