Measurement Theory and Uncertainty Analysis

This module provides comprehensive tools for scientific measurement analysis,
uncertainty quantification, and error propagation. Implements statistical
methods for experimental data analysis, calibration procedures, and measurement
quality assessment following international measurement standards (GUM, ISO).

Key Features:
- Statistical uncertainty analysis with Type A and Type B evaluation
- Error propagation through complex measurement equations
- Calibration curve fitting and uncertainty estimation
- Measurement repeatability and reproducibility analysis
- Systematic error identification and correction procedures
- Measurement system analysis (MSA) and gauge R&R studies
- Traceability chain analysis and uncertainty budgets
- Confidence interval calculation with proper statistical methods
- Outlier detection and robust statistical estimators
- Measurement uncertainty reporting following GUM guidelines

Scientific Foundation:
Follows Guide to Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and
ISO/IEC 17025 standards for uncertainty evaluation. Distinguishes between
random uncertainties (Type A) evaluated by statistical methods and systematic
uncertainties (Type B) evaluated by other means. Combines uncertainties
using law of propagation of uncertainties.

Statistical Methods:
Implements both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to uncertainty evaluation,
with proper handling of correlation effects, non-linear measurement models,
and non-Gaussian uncertainty distributions. Provides Monte Carlo methods
for complex uncertainty propagation scenarios.
