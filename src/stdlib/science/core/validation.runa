Scientific Data Validation and Quality Assessment

This module provides comprehensive tools for validating scientific data,
detecting anomalies, and assessing data quality. Implements statistical
tests, physical constraint checking, and data integrity verification
methods essential for reliable scientific computation and analysis.

Key Features:
- Statistical outlier detection with multiple algorithms and robust methods
- Physical constraint validation (conservation laws, thermodynamic limits)
- Data consistency checking across related measurements and variables
- Range and bounds validation with context-aware limit determination
- Temporal consistency analysis for time-series scientific data
- Cross-validation techniques for model and measurement validation
- Data completeness assessment and missing data pattern analysis
- Uncertainty validation and propagation consistency checking
- Instrument-specific validation rules and drift detection
- Quality scoring and data reliability assessment frameworks

Validation Philosophy:
Scientific data validation requires both statistical rigor and domain
knowledge. Statistical methods identify numerical anomalies, while physical
constraints ensure scientific plausibility. The module combines both
approaches to provide comprehensive data quality assessment.

Quality Assurance:
Implements international standards for scientific data quality (ISO 8000,
FAIR principles) and provides traceability for validation decisions.
Supports both automated validation pipelines and interactive data
exploration workflows.
