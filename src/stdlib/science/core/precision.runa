Scientific Precision and Significant Figure Management

This module provides comprehensive tools for managing precision, significant
figures, and numerical accuracy in scientific calculations. Implements proper
significant figure arithmetic rules, precision tracking through calculations,
and uncertainty quantification for experimental data analysis.

Key Features:
- Significant figure identification and counting with scientific notation
- Arithmetic operations preserving significant figure rules
- Precision tracking through complex calculation chains
- Rounding modes for different scientific contexts
- Relative and absolute precision measurement and comparison
- Guard digit management for intermediate calculations
- Scientific notation normalization and formatting
- Precision-aware comparison operations with tolerance bands
- Significant figure propagation through mathematical functions
- Quality metrics for numerical stability assessment

Scientific Foundation:
Significant figures represent the precision of measurements and calculated
values, following established rules for arithmetic operations. Addition and
subtraction are limited by absolute precision (decimal places), while
multiplication and division are limited by relative precision (significant
figures). Proper handling prevents false precision in computed results.

Numerical Considerations:
Implementation accounts for floating-point representation limitations,
binary-to-decimal conversion artifacts, and provides exact decimal arithmetic
when required. Maintains distinction between mathematical exactness and
measured precision throughout calculation chains.
