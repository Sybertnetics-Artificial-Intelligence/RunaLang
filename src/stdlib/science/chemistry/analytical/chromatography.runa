Note:
This module provides comprehensive chromatography analysis capabilities including 
gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer 
chromatography (TLC), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), ion chromatography (IC), 
size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and advanced multidimensional separation techniques.
It covers method development, optimization, quantitative analysis, peak identification, 
retention modeling, column selection, mobile phase optimization, and automated method 
transfer for analytical and preparative separations.
