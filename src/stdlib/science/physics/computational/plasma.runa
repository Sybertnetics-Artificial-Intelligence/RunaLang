Plasma Physics Computational Methods

This module provides comprehensive computational tools for plasma physics
simulations and analysis. Features particle-in-cell (PIC) methods, magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) simulations, kinetic theory, plasma instabilities, fusion plasma modeling,
and space plasma physics. Includes both fluid and kinetic descriptions of
plasma behavior with electromagnetic field calculations.

Key Features:
- Particle-in-cell methods: electrostatic and electromagnetic PIC with Boris particle pusher
- Magnetohydrodynamics: ideal and resistive MHD with shock-capturing numerical schemes
- Plasma kinetics: Vlasov equation solvers and collisional transport calculations
- Field solvers: Poisson equation, Maxwell equations, and finite-difference time-domain methods
- Plasma instabilities: two-stream, Weibel, drift waves, and ballooning mode analysis
- Fusion plasma modeling: tokamak geometry, neoclassical transport, and alpha particle physics
- Space plasma physics: magnetosphere dynamics, solar wind interactions, and particle acceleration
- Boundary conditions: absorbing layers, conducting walls, and plasma-wall interactions
- Collisional processes: Monte Carlo collisions, Fokker-Planck operators, and thermalization
- Multi-species plasma: electrons, ions, and neutral particles with charge exchange reactions
- Magnetic confinement: magnetic field line tracing and guiding center approximations
- Plasma heating: ohmic heating, neutral beam injection, and radio frequency wave heating
- Diagnostics simulation: synthetic diagnostics for experimental comparison and validation
- Parallel computing: domain decomposition and load balancing for high-performance simulation

Physical Foundation:
Based on the fundamental equations of plasma physics including the Vlasov-Maxwell
system for kinetic descriptions and magnetohydrodynamics for fluid treatments.
Incorporates electromagnetic field theory, statistical mechanics, and collision
theory for comprehensive plasma modeling. Utilizes gyrokinetic ordering and
drift approximations for efficient reduced-dimensional simulations.

Applications:
Suitable for magnetic fusion energy research, space physics investigations, plasma
processing applications, and astrophysical plasma studies. Enables design of
magnetic confinement devices, analysis of space weather phenomena, optimization
of plasma-based technologies, and understanding of cosmic plasma processes.
