Monte Carlo Methods for Physics Simulations

This module provides comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation methods for statistical
mechanics and quantum systems. Features Metropolis algorithm, Wang-Landau sampling,
parallel tempering, cluster algorithms, quantum Monte Carlo methods, and
advanced sampling techniques. Includes methods for Ising models, lattice gases,
polymer chains, quantum systems, and general statistical mechanics problems.

Key Features:
- Markov chain Monte Carlo: Metropolis-Hastings, heat bath, and Gibbs sampling algorithms
- Advanced sampling methods: Wang-Landau, multicanonical, and histogram reweighting
- Cluster algorithms: Swendsen-Wang and Wolff cluster updates for critical slowing down
- Parallel tempering: replica exchange for enhanced sampling across temperature ranges
- Quantum Monte Carlo: variational, diffusion, and path integral methods
- Spin models: Ising, Potts, XY, and Heisenberg models on various lattice geometries
- Lattice gas simulations: grand canonical ensemble and phase transition studies
- Statistical analysis: autocorrelation functions, error estimation, and finite-size scaling
- Importance sampling: umbrella sampling and adaptive biasing force methods
- Bootstrap and jackknife error analysis for robust statistical uncertainty quantification
- Critical phenomena: Binder cumulant analysis and scaling theory applications
- Percolation theory: site and bond percolation with cluster size distributions
- Polymer simulations: self-avoiding walks, polymer collapse, and phase transitions
- Optimization algorithms: simulated annealing and genetic algorithm implementations

Physical Foundation:
Based on statistical mechanics principles and the fundamental theorem of Markov
chains ensuring detailed balance and ergodicity. Utilizes importance sampling
to evaluate high-dimensional integrals in statistical physics. Quantum Monte
Carlo methods employ the path integral formulation and variational principles
for many-body quantum systems.

Applications:
Suitable for condensed matter physics, critical phenomena studies, material science,
statistical physics research, and optimization problems. Enables investigation of
phase transitions, magnetic properties, quantum ground states, and thermodynamic
properties of complex many-body systems.
