Molecular Dynamics Simulations

This module provides comprehensive molecular dynamics simulation capabilities
for studying the physical movements and interactions of atoms and molecules.
Features N-body simulations, force field calculations, integration algorithms,
ensemble methods (NVE, NVT, NPT), periodic boundary conditions, and
advanced analysis tools for trajectory analysis and property calculations.
Supports classical MD, ab initio MD, and hybrid QM/MM approaches.

Key Features:
- Classical force fields: AMBER, CHARMM, GROMOS, OPLS-AA, and custom potentials
- Integration algorithms: Verlet, velocity-Verlet, leapfrog, and Runge-Kutta methods
- Ensemble methods: microcanonical (NVE), canonical (NVT), and isothermal-isobaric (NPT)
- Thermostat implementations: Nosé-Hoover, Berendsen, Langevin, and velocity rescaling
- Barostat algorithms: Parrinello-Rahman, Berendsen, and MTTK pressure coupling
- Periodic boundary conditions with minimum image convention and Ewald summation
- Long-range electrostatics: particle mesh Ewald (PME) and fast multipole methods
- Constraint algorithms: SHAKE, RATTLE, LINCS for bond and angle constraints
- Enhanced sampling methods: umbrella sampling, replica exchange, and metadynamics
- Advanced analysis: radial distribution functions, structure factors, and transport properties
- Energy minimization: steepest descent, conjugate gradient, and limited-memory BFGS
- Multi-scale modeling: QM/MM coupling and coarse-grained force fields
- Parallel algorithms: domain decomposition and particle decomposition strategies
- Trajectory analysis: hydrogen bonding, secondary structure, and conformational clustering

Physical Foundation:
Based on classical Newtonian mechanics with empirical potential energy functions
describing interatomic interactions. Integrates Hamilton's equations of motion
using symplectic algorithms to conserve phase space volume. Extends to quantum
mechanical descriptions through Car-Parrinello and Born-Oppenheimer molecular
dynamics for electronic structure calculations during simulation.

Applications:
Suitable for protein folding studies, drug discovery, materials science, surface
chemistry, and biomolecular recognition. Enables investigation of thermodynamic
properties, phase transitions, diffusion processes, and chemical reaction dynamics
in complex molecular systems.
