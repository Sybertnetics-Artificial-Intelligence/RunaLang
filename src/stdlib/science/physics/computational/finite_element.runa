Finite Element Methods for Physics Simulations

This module provides comprehensive finite element analysis capabilities for
solving partial differential equations in physics and engineering. Features
mesh generation, element formulations, assembly procedures, solvers, and
post-processing tools. Supports structural mechanics, heat transfer, fluid flow,
electromagnetics, and multiphysics problems with linear and nonlinear analysis.

Key Features:
- Element libraries: linear, quadratic, and higher-order finite elements for 1D, 2D, and 3D problems
- Mesh generation: structured and unstructured mesh creation with adaptive refinement capabilities
- Shape functions: Lagrange, Hermite, and hierarchical basis functions with numerical integration
- Assembly procedures: global stiffness matrix and force vector construction from element contributions
- Solver algorithms: direct sparse solvers, iterative methods, and eigenvalue problem solutions
- Structural mechanics: linear elasticity, plasticity, viscoelasticity, and large deformation analysis
- Heat transfer: steady-state and transient thermal analysis with conduction, convection, and radiation
- Fluid dynamics: incompressible flow using mixed formulations and stabilized methods
- Electromagnetics: electrostatics, magnetostatics, and time-harmonic electromagnetic field analysis
- Multiphysics coupling: thermal-structural, fluid-structure, and electromagnetic-thermal interactions
- Nonlinear analysis: Newton-Raphson, arc-length, and line search methods for nonlinear systems
- Contact mechanics: penalty methods, Lagrange multipliers, and augmented Lagrangian formulations
- Dynamic analysis: modal analysis, harmonic response, and transient time integration schemes
- Error estimation: a posteriori error indicators and adaptive mesh refinement strategies

Physical Foundation:
Based on the weighted residual method and Galerkin formulation for weak form
solutions of partial differential equations. Utilizes variational principles
and energy methods for systematic derivation of element matrices. Extends to
nonlinear problems through incremental-iterative solution procedures and
multiphysics coupling through partitioned or monolithic approaches.

Applications:
Suitable for structural engineering, thermal analysis, computational fluid dynamics,
electromagnetic field analysis, and multiphysics simulations. Enables design
optimization, failure analysis, heat exchanger design, antenna modeling, and
coupled field problems in engineering and applied physics.
