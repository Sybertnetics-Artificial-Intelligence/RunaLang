Lattice-Based Computational Physics Methods

This module provides comprehensive lattice-based simulation methods for
condensed matter physics and field theory. Features lattice gas automata,
lattice Boltzmann methods, quantum chromodynamics on the lattice, spin
lattice models, and percolation theory. Includes both classical and quantum
lattice systems with various geometries and boundary conditions.

Key Features:
- Lattice geometries: square, triangular, honeycomb, cubic, face-centered cubic, and body-centered cubic
- Lattice Boltzmann methods: D2Q9, D3Q19, and D3Q27 models for fluid dynamics simulation
- Spin lattice models: Ising, Potts, XY, and Heisenberg models with various interaction types
- Lattice gas automata: HPP, FHP, and other particle-based fluid simulation methods
- Quantum lattice models: Hubbard model, t-J model, and fermionic lattice systems
- Lattice gauge theory: Wilson action, plaquette calculations, and confinement studies
- Percolation theory: site and bond percolation with cluster analysis algorithms
- Cellular automata: Conway's Game of Life, elementary CA, and complex adaptive systems
- Boundary conditions: periodic, reflecting, open, and mixed boundary implementations
- Critical phenomena: finite-size scaling, correlation length calculations, and phase transitions
- Transport phenomena: diffusion, heat conduction, and viscous flow on discrete lattices
- Quantum field theory: lattice QCD, scalar field theory, and gauge field dynamics
- Parallel algorithms: domain decomposition and efficient lattice update strategies
- Phase diagram mapping: temperature-field phase space exploration and critical point identification

Physical Foundation:
Based on discrete space-time formulations of continuous physical systems using
finite difference approximations. Lattice Boltzmann methods derive from kinetic
theory and the discrete velocity Boltzmann equation. Lattice gauge theories
provide non-perturbative approaches to quantum field theory through path integral
discretization on hypercubic lattices.

Applications:
Suitable for fluid dynamics simulation, condensed matter physics research, quantum
field theory calculations, materials science modeling, and complex systems analysis.
Enables investigation of phase transitions, critical phenomena, transport properties,
and quantum many-body systems in discrete space-time formulations.
