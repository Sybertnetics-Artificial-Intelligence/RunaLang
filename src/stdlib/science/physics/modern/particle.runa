Particle Physics and High-Energy Physics

This module provides comprehensive tools for particle physics calculations
including the Standard Model, particle interactions, cross sections, decay
rates, and accelerator physics. Implements quantum field theory methods,
symmetries, and conservation laws governing fundamental particles.

Key Features:
- Standard Model particles: quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, and Higgs boson
- Fundamental interactions: electromagnetic, weak, strong, and gravitational
- Feynman diagrams: construction and amplitude calculations
- Cross sections and decay rates using perturbation theory
- Symmetries and conservation laws: CPT, gauge invariance, chiral symmetry
- Particle accelerator physics: beam dynamics and collision kinematics
- Detector physics: particle identification and energy measurements
- Neutrino physics: oscillations, masses, and mixing parameters
- Beyond Standard Model: supersymmetry, extra dimensions, dark matter
- Cosmological particle physics: Big Bang nucleosynthesis, inflation

Physical Foundation:
Based on quantum field theory and the Standard Model of particle physics,
describing fundamental particles as excitations of quantum fields with
interactions mediated by gauge bosons. Incorporates special relativity
and quantum mechanics in the high-energy regime.

Applications:
Essential for high-energy physics experiments, accelerator design, detector
development, astroparticle physics, and theoretical investigations of
physics beyond the Standard Model including dark matter and dark energy.
