Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity

This module provides comprehensive tools for nuclear physics calculations
including nuclear structure, radioactive decay, nuclear reactions, and
applications in nuclear technology. Implements nuclear models, decay
chains, and reaction cross sections for both fundamental and applied
nuclear physics.

Key Features:
- Nuclear structure: shell model, liquid drop model, nuclear magic numbers
- Radioactive decay: alpha, beta, gamma decay with branching ratios
- Nuclear reactions: cross sections, Q-values, and reaction kinematics
- Fission and fusion processes: energy release and product distributions
- Nuclear binding energies and mass-energy relationships
- Neutron physics: moderation, absorption, and reactor physics
- Nuclear astrophysics: stellar nucleosynthesis and r/s-process
- Radiation detection and nuclear instrumentation principles
- Nuclear medicine: radiopharmaceuticals and imaging techniques
- Nuclear waste and activation calculations

Physical Foundation:
Based on quantum mechanics applied to systems of nucleons (protons and
neutrons) bound by the strong nuclear force. Includes both microscopic
quantum mechanical models and macroscopic statistical approaches for
nuclear properties and reactions.

Applications:
Essential for nuclear reactor design, nuclear medicine, radiological
protection, nuclear waste management, nuclear astrophysics, and
fundamental research into nuclear structure and nuclear matter.
