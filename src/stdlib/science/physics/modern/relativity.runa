Special and General Relativity

This module provides comprehensive tools for relativistic physics calculations
including special relativity (Lorentz transformations, time dilation, length
contraction) and general relativity (curved spacetime, Einstein field equations,
black holes). Implements four-vector formalism and tensor calculations.

Key Features:
- Special relativity: Lorentz transformations, four-vectors, relativistic mechanics
- Minkowski spacetime geometry and invariant interval calculations
- Relativistic energy-momentum relations E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²
- Time dilation, length contraction, and simultaneity effects
- General relativity: metric tensors, curvature, and Einstein field equations
- Schwarzschild solution: black holes and gravitational time dilation
- Cosmological models: Friedmann equations and expanding universe
- Gravitational waves: linearized theory and detection principles
- Tests of relativity: perihelion precession, light bending, frame dragging
- Relativistic astrophysics: neutron stars, accretion disks, and jets

Physical Foundation:
Based on the principle of relativity (physics laws identical in all inertial
frames) and the universality of light speed. General relativity extends this
to include gravity as curved spacetime geometry, unifying space, time, and
gravitation in Einstein's field equations.

Applications:
Essential for GPS satellite corrections, particle accelerator design,
astrophysical modeling, cosmology, and any high-energy or high-precision
application where relativistic effects become significant.
