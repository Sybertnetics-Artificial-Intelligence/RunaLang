Statistical Mechanics and Ensemble Theory

This module provides comprehensive tools for statistical mechanics including
equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems, ensemble theory, phase transitions,
and critical phenomena. Implements the connection between microscopic physics
and macroscopic thermodynamic properties through statistical methods.

Key Features:
- Microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensemble formulations
- Partition functions and thermodynamic potential calculations
- Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Bose-Einstein statistics
- Phase transitions: mean-field theory, critical exponents, scaling laws
- Ising model and other lattice models for cooperative phenomena
- Monte Carlo methods for statistical system simulation
- Fluctuation-dissipation theorem and response functions
- Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and transport phenomena
- Kinetic theory and Boltzmann equation for gas dynamics
- Stochastic processes and Langevin dynamics

Physical Foundation:
Based on the statistical interpretation of thermodynamics using probability
theory and ensemble averages. Connects microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics
to macroscopic observables through the fundamental postulate of equal
a priori probabilities for isolated systems.

Applications:
Essential for condensed matter physics, materials science, biophysics,
plasma physics, and any system involving large numbers of particles
where statistical averaging provides meaningful predictions.
