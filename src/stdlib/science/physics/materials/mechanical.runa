Mechanical Properties of Materials

This module provides comprehensive analysis tools for mechanical properties
of materials including stress-strain behavior, elastic constants, plasticity,
fracture mechanics, fatigue analysis, creep behavior, hardness testing,
and mechanical characterization of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites.

Key Features:
- Stress-strain analysis: tensile, compressive, shear, and complex loading conditions
- Elastic constants determination: Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus, Poisson's ratio
- Plasticity models: von Mises, Tresca, Mohr-Coulomb yield criteria and flow rules
- Fracture mechanics: stress intensity factors, J-integral, crack propagation analysis
- Fatigue life prediction: S-N curves, Paris law, low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue
- Creep behavior modeling: primary, secondary, and tertiary creep mechanisms
- Hardness testing analysis: Vickers, Brinell, Rockwell, and microhardness methods
- Composite mechanics: laminate theory, fiber-matrix interactions, failure modes
- Viscoelastic behavior: relaxation modulus, creep compliance, dynamic mechanical analysis
- Anisotropic material properties: orthotropic and transversely isotropic materials
- Thermal stress analysis: thermal expansion, thermal shock, and thermomechanical coupling
- Dynamic mechanical properties: wave propagation, vibration analysis, impact testing
- Material characterization: tensile testing, compression testing, three-point bending
- Failure analysis: brittle fracture, ductile failure, environmental stress cracking

Physical Foundation:
Based on continuum mechanics principles including elasticity theory, plasticity
theory, and fracture mechanics. Incorporates constitutive equations, yield criteria,
and damage mechanics models for comprehensive mechanical behavior prediction
across multiple length scales from atomic to macroscopic.

Applications:
Suitable for structural engineering, materials selection, failure analysis,
quality control, aerospace applications, automotive engineering, and biomedical
device design. Supports both experimental data analysis and theoretical modeling.
