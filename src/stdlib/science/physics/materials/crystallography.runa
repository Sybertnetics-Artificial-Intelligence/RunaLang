Crystallography and Crystal Structure Analysis

This module provides comprehensive tools for crystallographic analysis and
crystal structure determination including crystal lattices, space groups,
symmetry operations, X-ray diffraction analysis, structure factor calculations,
powder diffraction, single crystal analysis, and crystal defects analysis.

Key Features:
- Crystal lattice systems: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, hexagonal, trigonal, monoclinic, triclinic
- Space group determination and symmetry operation analysis (230 space groups)
- Unit cell parameter refinement and lattice constant calculations  
- Structure factor calculations for X-ray, neutron, and electron diffraction
- Powder diffraction pattern simulation and peak indexing algorithms
- Single crystal diffraction data processing and structure solution methods
- Reciprocal lattice construction and Ewald sphere geometry calculations
- Crystal defects: point defects, dislocations, grain boundaries, and stacking faults
- Phase identification using diffraction databases and search-match algorithms
- Texture analysis and preferred orientation quantification methods
- Crystal morphology prediction using Wulff construction and growth models
- Twinning analysis and twin law determination procedures
- Temperature factor analysis and atomic displacement parameter refinement
- Crystal chemistry relationships and bond length/angle analysis tools

Physical Foundation:
Based on crystallographic principles derived from X-ray diffraction theory,
including Bragg's law, structure factor equations, and systematic absences.
Incorporates space group theory, point group symmetry, and lattice geometry
for complete structural characterization of crystalline materials.

Applications:
Suitable for materials characterization, pharmaceutical polymorphism studies,
mineralogy, metallurgy, solid-state chemistry, and quality control applications.
Supports both laboratory and synchrotron X-ray diffraction data analysis.
