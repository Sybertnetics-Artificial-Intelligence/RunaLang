Magnetic Properties of Materials

This module provides comprehensive analysis tools for magnetic properties
of materials including magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, hysteresis,
magnetic domains, spin dynamics, magnetic phase transitions, and advanced
magnetic phenomena in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and complex spin systems.

Key Features:
- Magnetization analysis: saturation magnetization, remanent magnetization, coercive field measurements
- Magnetic susceptibility: temperature dependence, field dependence, anisotropic susceptibility
- Hysteresis loop analysis: energy product, switching fields, magnetic domain reversal mechanisms
- Magnetic phase transitions: Curie temperature, Néel temperature, spin reorientation transitions
- Exchange interactions: direct exchange, superexchange, double exchange, RKKY interactions
- Magnetic anisotropy: magnetocrystalline, shape, surface, and stress-induced anisotropy
- Domain structure analysis: domain walls, magnetic bubbles, vortex states, skyrmions
- Spin dynamics: ferromagnetic resonance, spin waves, magnons, Gilbert damping
- Magnetic ordering: ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, spin glasses
- Magnetocaloric effects: adiabatic temperature change, entropy change, refrigeration applications
- Magnetoresistance phenomena: GMR, TMR, AMR, and colossal magnetoresistance effects
- Magnetic characterization: VSM, SQUID, torque magnetometry, neutron scattering analysis
- Micromagnetic modeling: energy minimization, demagnetization fields, exchange stiffness
- Spintronics applications: spin injection, spin transport, magnetic memory devices

Physical Foundation:
Based on quantum mechanical exchange interactions, crystal field theory,
and magnetic dipole interactions. Incorporates Heisenberg model, Ising model,
and Landau theory for magnetic phase transitions, along with relativistic
effects for magnetic anisotropy and magnetocrystalline energy contributions.

Applications:
Suitable for magnetic materials design, permanent magnet development,
magnetic recording technology, spintronics device engineering, and
magnetic sensor applications. Supports both fundamental research and
industrial applications in magnetic materials characterization.
