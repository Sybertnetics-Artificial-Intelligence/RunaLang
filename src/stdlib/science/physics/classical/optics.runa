Geometrical and Wave Optics

This module provides comprehensive tools for optical calculations including
geometrical optics (ray tracing), wave optics (interference, diffraction),
and polarization phenomena. Implements lens systems, optical instruments,
coherence theory, and light-matter interactions.

Key Features:
- Ray optics: reflection, refraction, and optical system design
- Lens and mirror systems: focal lengths, aberrations, and image formation
- Wave optics: interference, diffraction, and coherence phenomena
- Polarization: linear, circular, elliptical, and birefringence effects
- Optical instruments: microscopes, telescopes, spectrometers, interferometers
- Fiber optics: guided waves, numerical aperture, and dispersion
- Nonlinear optics: frequency mixing, phase matching, and optical bistability
- Laser physics: gain media, resonators, and beam propagation
- Photonic crystals and metamaterials: bandgap structures and negative refraction
- Quantum optics foundations: photon statistics and squeezed states

Physical Foundation:
Based on Maxwell's electromagnetic theory with additional approximations
for geometrical optics (short wavelength limit) and specialized phenomena
like nonlinear response and quantum effects. Includes both classical
wave theory and emerging quantum optical phenomena.

Applications:
Suitable for optical engineering, laser design, imaging systems, optical
communications, spectroscopy, and photonics research applications.
