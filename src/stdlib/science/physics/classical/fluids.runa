Fluid Dynamics and Continuum Mechanics

This module provides comprehensive tools for fluid mechanics calculations
including viscous and inviscid flow, compressible and incompressible flow,
turbulence modeling, and computational fluid dynamics. Implements the
Navier-Stokes equations and specialized flow solutions.

Key Features:
- Fundamental equations: continuity, momentum (Navier-Stokes), energy
- Inviscid flow theory: potential flow, vorticity, and circulation
- Viscous flow: boundary layers, pipe flow, and drag calculations
- Compressible flow: shock waves, expansion fans, and gas dynamics
- Turbulence modeling: RANS, LES, and DNS approaches
- Heat and mass transfer in flowing fluids
- Non-Newtonian fluid behavior and rheology
- Multiphase flow: gas-liquid, solid-liquid systems
- Microfluidics: low Reynolds number flows and surface effects
- Geophysical fluid dynamics: atmospheric and oceanic flows

Physical Foundation:
Based on conservation laws (mass, momentum, energy) applied to continuous
fluid media. Includes both Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of fluid
motion, with appropriate constitutive relations for different fluid types.

Applications:
Suitable for aerospace engineering, chemical process design, weather
prediction, oceanography, biofluid mechanics, and any application
requiring fluid flow analysis and prediction.
