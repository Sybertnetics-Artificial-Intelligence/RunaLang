Acoustics and Sound Wave Phenomena

This module provides comprehensive tools for acoustic analysis including
sound wave propagation, room acoustics, psychoacoustics, and vibration
analysis. Implements wave equations, acoustic impedance calculations,
and sound quality metrics for architectural and engineering applications.

Key Features:
- Sound wave propagation in various media (air, water, solids)
- Acoustic impedance and reflection/transmission at interfaces
- Room acoustics: reverberation time, absorption, and diffusion
- Noise analysis: sound pressure levels, frequency weighting, and metrics
- Psychoacoustics: loudness, pitch perception, and auditory masking
- Vibration analysis: modal analysis and structural acoustics
- Acoustic transducers: microphones, loudspeakers, and hydrophones
- Ultrasonic applications: medical imaging and non-destructive testing
- Architectural acoustics: concert halls, theaters, and noise control
- Underwater acoustics: sonar systems and marine sound propagation

Physical Foundation:
Based on the acoustic wave equation derived from fluid mechanics principles,
including effects of viscosity, thermal conduction, and nonlinear propagation.
Extends to elastic wave propagation in solids and coupled fluid-structure
systems for comprehensive vibro-acoustic analysis.

Applications:
Suitable for architectural acoustics, audio engineering, medical ultrasonics,
sonar design, noise control engineering, and musical instrument analysis.
Includes both analytical solutions and numerical modeling approaches.
