Classical Electromagnetism and Maxwell's Equations

This module provides comprehensive tools for classical electromagnetism
including electrostatics, magnetostatics, electromagnetic induction, and
wave propagation. Implements Maxwell's equations, circuit analysis, and
electromagnetic field calculations in various coordinate systems.

Key Features:

- Magnetostatics: Biot-Savart law, Ampère's law, and magnetic field analysis
- Maxwell's equations in differential and integral forms
- Electromagnetic induction: Faraday's law, Lenz's law, and motional EMF
- Electromagnetic wave propagation in vacuum and media
- Circuit analysis: DC and AC circuits, impedance, and network analysis
- Electromagnetic boundary conditions and interface problems
- Antenna theory and radiation from accelerating charges
- Electromagnetic energy, momentum, and Poynting vector
- Special cases: multipole expansions, waveguides, and transmission lines

Physical Foundation:
Based on Maxwell's four fundamental equations describing electromagnetic
phenomena, unified with special relativity through the electromagnetic
field tensor. Includes both static and dynamic field configurations.

Suitable for electrical engineering, antenna design, electromagnetic
compatibility, plasma physics, and any application requiring electromagnetic
field analysis or circuit design.
