Classical Mechanics and Newtonian Dynamics

This module provides comprehensive tools for classical mechanics calculations
including kinematics, dynamics, rigid body motion, and energy methods.
Implements Newton's laws, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and conservation
principles for point particles, systems of particles, and rigid bodies.

Key Features:
- Kinematics: position, velocity, acceleration in 1D, 2D, and 3D
- Newton's laws and force analysis with free body diagrams
- Work-energy theorem and conservation of mechanical energy
- Linear and angular momentum conservation principles
- Rigid body dynamics: rotation, moments of inertia, Euler's equations
- Oscillatory motion: simple harmonic, damped, and driven oscillators
- Central force problems: planetary motion, scattering theory
- Lagrangian mechanics with generalized coordinates
- Hamiltonian mechanics and canonical transformations
- Collision theory: elastic and inelastic collisions

Physical Foundation:
Based on Newton's three laws of motion and universal gravitation, extended
to include Euler-Lagrange equations, Hamilton's principle, and canonical
mechanics. Provides both vectorial and analytical mechanics approaches
for solving complex mechanical systems.

Applications:
Suitable for engineering mechanics, celestial mechanics, molecular dynamics
preparation, robotics, and educational physics simulations. Includes both
exact analytical solutions and numerical integration methods.
