Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics

This module provides comprehensive tools for classical thermodynamics,
statistical mechanics, and heat transfer calculations. Implements the
fundamental laws of thermodynamics, equations of state, phase transitions,
and statistical mechanical foundations of thermodynamic properties.

Key Features:
- Laws of thermodynamics and thermodynamic processes (isothermal, adiabatic, etc.)
- Equations of state: ideal gas, van der Waals, Redlich-Kwong, and others
- Phase transitions and phase diagrams with critical point analysis
- Heat engines, refrigeration cycles, and thermodynamic efficiency calculations
- Statistical mechanics: Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein statistics
- Thermodynamic potentials: internal energy, enthalpy, Helmholtz, Gibbs free energy
- Chemical thermodynamics: reaction equilibria, activity coefficients
- Heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation mechanisms
- Kinetic theory of gases and transport properties
- Entropy calculations and the second law applications

Physical Foundation:
Based on the four laws of thermodynamics and statistical mechanical principles
connecting microscopic molecular behavior to macroscopic thermodynamic properties.
Includes both equilibrium thermodynamics and irreversible processes.

Applications:
Suitable for chemical engineering, materials science, power systems analysis,
climate modeling, and any application requiring thermal property calculations
or heat transfer analysis.
