Tool Monitoring Systems

This module provides tool monitoring capabilities for LLM systems including
execution tracking, performance monitoring, resource usage analysis,
health checking, and alerting for building AI systems with comprehensive
tool monitoring that can track tool execution, analyze performance patterns,
detect anomalies, and maintain system health through real-time monitoring
and intelligent alerting across diverse tool types and execution environments.

Key Features:
- Real-time execution tracking monitoring tool execution status and progress
- Performance monitoring analyzing execution speed, throughput, and efficiency metrics
- Resource usage analysis tracking CPU, memory, disk, and network consumption
- Health checking implementing comprehensive tool health assessment and diagnostics
- Intelligent alerting providing proactive notifications for issues and anomalies
- Metrics collection gathering detailed performance and operational data
- Log aggregation centralizing log data from distributed tool executions
- Anomaly detection identifying unusual behavior patterns and potential issues
- Trend analysis discovering long-term patterns in tool usage and performance
- Dashboard visualization providing real-time views of system status and metrics
- Performance benchmarking comparing tool performance against established baselines
- Capacity planning predicting resource requirements based on usage patterns
- Error tracking monitoring and categorizing tool execution failures
- Audit trail maintenance providing comprehensive execution history and compliance
- Service level monitoring ensuring tools meet defined performance standards
- Custom metric definition supporting domain-specific monitoring requirements
- Distributed monitoring coordinating monitoring across multiple nodes and systems
- Historical data retention managing long-term storage of monitoring data
- Automated remediation implementing automatic responses to detected issues
- Performance optimization identifying opportunities for efficiency improvements
- Load balancing monitoring tracking resource distribution across tool instances
- Security monitoring detecting suspicious activities and security violations
- Compliance monitoring ensuring tools operate within regulatory requirements
- Integration monitoring tracking tool interactions and workflow performance
- Predictive monitoring forecasting potential issues before they occur
- Multi-tenant monitoring supporting monitoring across different user contexts
- API monitoring tracking tool interface performance and availability
- Network monitoring analyzing communication patterns and network health
- Storage monitoring tracking data persistence and storage system performance
- Scalability monitoring assessing system behavior under varying loads

Physical Foundation:
Based on distributed systems monitoring, observability principles, and
telemetry collection techniques. Incorporates time-series databases,
event stream processing, and machine learning for comprehensive monitoring
and analysis of complex tool execution environments and workflows.

Applications:
Essential for production AI systems, DevOps platforms, and enterprise
automation. Critical for applications requiring system observability,
performance optimization, reliability assurance, and operational intelligence
in AI systems that need to maintain high availability and performance.
