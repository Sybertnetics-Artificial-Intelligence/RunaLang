Tool Sandboxing Systems

This module provides tool sandboxing capabilities for LLM systems including
isolated execution environments, resource containment, security boundaries,
access control, and containment monitoring for building AI systems with
secure tool execution that can run untrusted tools in controlled environments
while preventing malicious behavior, limiting resource consumption, and
maintaining system integrity through comprehensive isolation and monitoring.

Key Features:
- Isolated execution environments providing complete separation from host system
- Resource containment limiting CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- Security boundaries preventing unauthorized access to system resources
- Access control managing permissions and capabilities within sandbox environments
- Containment monitoring tracking sandbox behavior and resource utilization
- Process isolation preventing tools from interfering with each other
- Filesystem sandboxing restricting file access to designated areas
- Network isolation controlling network connectivity and communication
- System call filtering blocking dangerous or unauthorized system calls
- Privilege separation running tools with minimal necessary permissions
- Container orchestration managing multiple sandbox instances efficiently
- Sandbox lifecycle management handling creation, execution, and cleanup
- Security policy enforcement implementing fine-grained security controls
- Resource quota management preventing resource exhaustion attacks
- Sandbox migration supporting movement of executing tools between environments
- Vulnerability containment preventing exploitation of tool vulnerabilities
- Audit logging maintaining detailed records of sandbox activities
- Performance isolation ensuring tools don't impact system performance
- Data isolation preventing unauthorized data access and leakage
- Temporal isolation limiting execution time and preventing runaway processes
- Sandbox templates providing pre-configured secure execution environments
- Dynamic sandboxing adapting isolation based on tool risk assessment
- Sandbox clustering supporting distributed sandbox execution
- Recovery mechanisms handling sandbox failures and corruption
- Compliance enforcement ensuring tools operate within regulatory boundaries
- Sandbox analytics providing insights into tool behavior and security
- Custom isolation policies supporting domain-specific security requirements
- Sandbox federation coordinating sandboxes across multiple systems
- Real-time monitoring providing immediate visibility into sandbox status
- Automated threat response implementing immediate containment of malicious behavior

Physical Foundation:
Based on operating system virtualization, containerization technologies,
and security isolation principles. Incorporates hypervisor technologies,
namespace isolation, and capability-based security models for comprehensive
containment of potentially dangerous or untrusted code execution.

Applications:
Essential for secure AI platforms, untrusted code execution, and high-security
environments. Critical for applications requiring safe execution of third-party
tools, protection against malicious code, regulatory compliance, and robust
security in AI systems that must execute diverse and potentially untrusted tools.
