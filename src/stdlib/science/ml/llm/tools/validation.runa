Tool Validation Systems

This module provides tool validation capabilities for LLM systems including
input validation, output verification, constraint checking, security scanning,
and compliance testing for building AI systems with robust tool validation
that can verify tool correctness, ensure security compliance, validate
data integrity, and maintain system reliability across diverse tool types
and execution environments with comprehensive validation and verification.

Key Features:
- Input validation ensuring tool inputs meet type and constraint requirements
- Output verification confirming tool outputs match expected specifications
- Constraint checking validating adherence to operational and security constraints
- Security scanning detecting potential vulnerabilities and malicious code
- Compliance testing verifying tools meet regulatory and organizational standards
- Type checking ensuring data types match expected tool interface specifications
- Range validation confirming numeric values fall within acceptable bounds
- Format validation verifying data formats conform to required specifications
- Schema validation ensuring structured data matches defined schemas
- Business rule validation checking compliance with domain-specific rules
- Performance validation verifying tools meet efficiency and resource requirements
- Compatibility validation ensuring tools work correctly with system components
- Regression testing validating tool behavior remains consistent across versions
- Integration testing verifying tools work correctly in composed workflows
- Load testing validating tool performance under various usage scenarios
- Security audit scanning for common vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- Code quality analysis evaluating tool implementation for best practices
- Documentation validation ensuring tools have complete and accurate documentation
- Metadata validation verifying tool registration information is correct
- Version validation ensuring tool versions are compatible with system requirements
- Dependency validation checking tool dependencies are satisfied and secure
- Configuration validation verifying tool settings and parameters are correct
- Error handling validation ensuring tools properly handle failure scenarios
- Resource usage validation checking tools comply with resource consumption limits
- Data privacy validation ensuring tools handle sensitive data appropriately
- Access control validation verifying proper permission and authorization handling
- Audit trail validation ensuring tools maintain proper logging and tracking
- Rollback validation verifying tools can safely undo their operations
- Monitoring validation ensuring tools provide adequate observability
- Custom validation supporting domain-specific validation requirements and rules

Physical Foundation:
Based on software testing methodologies, formal verification techniques,
and security assessment frameworks. Incorporates quality assurance practices,
validation theory, and compliance frameworks for comprehensive verification
of tool correctness, security, and reliability in complex software systems.

Applications:
Essential for secure AI platforms, regulated environments, and mission-critical
systems. Critical for applications requiring verified tool behavior, security
compliance, regulatory adherence, and high reliability in AI systems that
must maintain strict quality and security standards across all components.
