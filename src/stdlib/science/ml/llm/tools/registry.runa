Tool Registry Systems

This module provides tool registry capabilities for LLM systems including
tool discovery, registration, metadata management, capability indexing,
and version control for building AI systems with comprehensive tool
management that can dynamically discover, register, and organize available
tools while maintaining detailed metadata, capability information, and
version history for efficient tool selection and utilization across systems.

Key Features:
- Dynamic tool discovery automatically detecting available tools and capabilities
- Tool registration system managing enrollment of new tools with metadata
- Comprehensive metadata management storing detailed tool information and specifications
- Capability indexing organizing tools by their functional capabilities and domains
- Version control tracking tool evolution and maintaining compatibility information
- Tool categorization organizing tools by functionality, domain, and use cases
- Dependency management tracking tool requirements and inter-tool relationships
- Tool lifecycle management monitoring tool status from registration to retirement
- Search and filtering capabilities enabling efficient tool discovery and selection
- Tool validation ensuring registered tools meet quality and security standards
- Registry synchronization coordinating tool information across distributed systems
- Tool compatibility checking ensuring tools work together in compositions
- Usage analytics tracking tool utilization patterns and performance metrics
- Tool recommendation suggesting appropriate tools based on context and requirements
- Registry backup and recovery ensuring tool information durability and availability
- Tool deprecation management handling obsolete tools and migration strategies
- Security and access control managing permissions and authorization for tool access
- Tool documentation integration maintaining comprehensive tool usage information
- Registry federation connecting multiple tool registries for broader tool access
- Tool certification managing approval and quality assurance processes
- Performance profiling tracking tool execution characteristics and resource requirements
- Tool composition support enabling complex workflows from multiple tools
- Registry monitoring tracking registry health and performance metrics
- Tool update notifications alerting users to new versions and important changes
- Bulk tool management supporting operations across multiple tools simultaneously
- Tool conflict resolution handling naming conflicts and duplicate registrations
- Registry APIs providing programmatic access to tool information and operations
- Tool marketplace integration connecting to external tool repositories and stores
- Custom metadata schemas supporting domain-specific tool classification systems
- Tool provenance tracking maintaining audit trails for tool origins and modifications

Physical Foundation:
Based on service registry patterns, software component management, and
distributed system design. Incorporates software engineering principles,
metadata management techniques, and registry design patterns for efficient
organization and discovery of tools in complex software ecosystems.

Applications:
Essential for AI platforms, automation systems, and tool-based workflows.
Critical for applications requiring dynamic tool discovery, systematic tool
organization, comprehensive tool management, and efficient tool utilization
in AI systems that leverage multiple tools and capabilities for complex tasks.
