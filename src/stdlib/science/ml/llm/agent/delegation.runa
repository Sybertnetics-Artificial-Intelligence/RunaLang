Task Delegation Framework

This module provides comprehensive task delegation capabilities for multi-LLM
systems including task decomposition strategies, agent capability matching,
workload distribution, result aggregation, and delegation chain tracking for
building sophisticated task delegation systems that can efficiently distribute
complex tasks across multiple specialized agents for optimal performance.

Key Features:
- Advanced task decomposition strategies breaking complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- Intelligent agent capability matching aligning tasks with optimal agent expertise
- Dynamic workload distribution balancing computational load across available agents
- Sophisticated result aggregation combining outputs from multiple delegated tasks
- Comprehensive delegation chain tracking maintaining complete task lineage
- Task dependency resolution ensuring proper execution order of subtasks
- Agent specialization awareness directing tasks to most suitable agents
- Dynamic delegation adjustment adapting to changing agent availability and performance
- Hierarchical delegation supporting multi-level task breakdown and assignment
- Task priority propagation maintaining priority across delegation hierarchy
- Delegation performance monitoring tracking efficiency of task distribution
- Adaptive delegation strategies learning from historical performance patterns
- Task context preservation maintaining relevant information across delegations
- Agent workload balancing preventing overload and ensuring optimal utilization
- Delegation security ensuring authorized task distribution and result handling
- Task failure handling with automatic redelegation and recovery mechanisms
- Multi-modal task support enabling delegation of diverse task types
- Delegation optimization algorithms maximizing efficiency of task distribution
- Agent coordination during delegation managing inter-agent communication needs
- Task completion validation ensuring quality and correctness of delegated results
- Delegation analytics providing insights into delegation patterns and performance
- Custom delegation patterns supporting domain-specific delegation requirements
- Delegation template system enabling reusable delegation workflows
- Resource-aware delegation considering computational and memory constraints

Physical Foundation:
Based on distributed computing principles, task scheduling algorithms, and
multi-agent coordination theory. Incorporates workflow decomposition concepts,
load balancing techniques, and resource allocation algorithms for efficient
distribution and coordination of computational tasks across agent networks.

Applications:
Essential for complex problem-solving systems, distributed AI processing,
and scalable LLM orchestration. Critical for applications requiring task
parallelization, specialized agent utilization, and efficient coordination
of multiple AI capabilities for large-scale cognitive processing tasks.
