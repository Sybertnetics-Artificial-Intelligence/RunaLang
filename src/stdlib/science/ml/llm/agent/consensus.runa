Multi-LLM Consensus

This module provides comprehensive consensus mechanisms for multi-LLM systems
including voting mechanisms, debate and discussion protocols, consensus
convergence algorithms, disagreement resolution, and confidence scoring for
building robust multi-agent decision-making systems that can reach reliable
agreements through collaborative reasoning and democratic decision processes.

Key Features:
- Multiple voting mechanisms including majority, weighted, and ranked voting systems
- Sophisticated debate and discussion protocols enabling structured agent dialogue
- Advanced consensus convergence algorithms ensuring reliable agreement formation
- Comprehensive disagreement resolution strategies for handling conflicting opinions
- Multi-dimensional confidence scoring providing reliability metrics for decisions
- Iterative consensus refinement through multiple rounds of discussion and voting
- Consensus quality assessment evaluating reliability and robustness of agreements
- Dynamic consensus strategies adapting to different problem types and contexts
- Minority opinion preservation ensuring valuable dissenting views are maintained
- Consensus validation mechanisms verifying agreement quality and consistency
- Time-bounded consensus with deadline management and partial agreement handling
- Expertise-weighted consensus incorporating agent specialization and competence levels
- Consensus explanation generation providing rationale for reached agreements
- Consensus monitoring and analytics tracking decision-making patterns and effectiveness
- Multi-criteria consensus supporting complex decisions with multiple evaluation dimensions
- Consensus security ensuring integrity and authenticity of the decision process
- Distributed consensus protocols enabling agreement across networked agent systems
- Consensus optimization algorithms improving efficiency and quality of agreement formation
- Adaptive quorum management adjusting participation requirements based on context
- Consensus failure handling with fallback strategies and alternative decision methods
- Real-time consensus tracking providing live updates on agreement formation progress
- Consensus template system enabling reusable agreement frameworks for common scenarios
- Meta-consensus capabilities for reaching agreements about decision-making processes
- Consensus integration with external validation sources and expert human input

Physical Foundation:
Based on distributed consensus algorithms from computer science, voting theory
from political science, and collective decision-making models from social
psychology. Incorporates game theory for strategic interactions, information
aggregation theory, and Byzantine fault tolerance principles for reliable
consensus in potentially adversarial environments.

Applications:
Essential for multi-agent decision-making, collaborative AI systems, and
distributed reasoning platforms. Critical for applications requiring reliable
group decisions, quality assurance through multiple AI perspectives, and
consensus-driven problem solving in complex domains requiring diverse expertise.
