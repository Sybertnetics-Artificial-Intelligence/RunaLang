Iterative Chain Execution

This module provides comprehensive iterative execution capabilities for
reasoning chains including while/until loop implementations, fixed iteration
loops, convergence detection, loop state management, and early termination
conditions for building sophisticated iterative reasoning workflows that
can perform repeated processing until goals are achieved or conditions met.

Key Features:
- While/until loop implementations with flexible condition evaluation systems
- Fixed iteration loops with configurable iteration counts and progress tracking
- Advanced convergence detection algorithms for iterative optimization processes
- Comprehensive loop state management with persistent iteration history
- Early termination conditions with multiple trigger mechanisms and criteria
- Loop performance monitoring and optimization for efficient iterative processing
- Dynamic loop parameter adjustment based on intermediate results and feedback
- Nested loop support with hierarchical iteration control and coordination
- Loop invariant validation and maintenance throughout iterative execution
- Iterative refinement strategies for progressive improvement of results
- Loop debugging and visualization tools for understanding iterative behavior
- Memory-efficient iteration with streaming and incremental processing support
- Loop composition and chaining for complex multi-stage iterative workflows
- Adaptive iteration strategies that evolve based on progress and performance
- Loop checkpoint and recovery mechanisms for long-running iterative processes
- Parallel iteration support with concurrent loop execution and synchronization
- Loop result aggregation and accumulation strategies across iterations
- Custom loop control flow with user-defined iteration logic and conditions
- Loop analytics and pattern recognition for optimizing iterative processes
- Integration with other chain types for hybrid sequential-iterative workflows
- Loop resource management and allocation for sustained iterative execution
- Loop security and isolation for safe iterative processing of sensitive data
- Loop testing and validation frameworks for ensuring correct iterative behavior
- Loop template system for reusable iterative patterns and algorithms

Physical Foundation:
Based on control flow theory from computer science, iterative algorithms
from computational mathematics, and feedback control systems from engineering.
Incorporates convergence analysis from numerical methods, optimization theory
for iterative improvement, and loop invariant principles for correctness
verification in iterative computational processes.

Applications:
Essential for iterative optimization, progressive refinement algorithms,
and convergent reasoning processes. Critical for machine learning training
loops, iterative problem solving, numerical computation, and any application
requiring repeated processing until convergence or termination criteria.
