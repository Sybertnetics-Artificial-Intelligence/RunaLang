Sequential Reasoning Chain Orchestration

This module provides sequential chain processing for complex multi-step reasoning
tasks including step-by-step execution, dependency management, intermediate
result validation, chain optimization, error recovery, and adaptive execution
strategies for building sophisticated AI workflows that require systematic
progression through interconnected reasoning stages.

Key Features:
- Sequential step execution with deterministic ordering and flow control
- Dependency resolution and prerequisite validation between chain steps
- Intermediate result validation and quality assurance at each stage
- Dynamic chain modification and step insertion during execution
- Error recovery and rollback mechanisms for failed chain steps
- Chain branching and conditional execution based on intermediate results
- Step timeout management and execution time monitoring
- Chain state persistence and recovery across execution sessions
- Parallel sub-chain execution within sequential framework
- Chain composition and nested chain execution capabilities
- Step result caching and memoization for efficiency optimization
- Chain debugging and introspection tools for development
- Adaptive step selection based on previous results and context
- Chain metrics collection and performance monitoring
- Step retry strategies with exponential backoff and circuit breakers
- Chain visualization and execution path tracking
- Resource management and cleanup between chain steps
- Chain templates and reusable workflow patterns
- Step parameterization and dynamic configuration injection
- Chain validation and integrity checking before execution
- Interactive chain execution with human-in-the-loop capabilities
- Chain optimization through execution pattern analysis
- Step prioritization and execution scheduling
- Chain result aggregation and final output synthesis

Physical Foundation:
Based on workflow orchestration principles, finite state machine theory,
and dependency graph algorithms. Incorporates control flow concepts from
programming languages, pipeline processing patterns from data engineering,
and orchestration patterns from distributed systems architecture.

Applications:
Essential for complex reasoning tasks, multi-step problem solving, and
automated decision-making systems. Critical for AI agents requiring
systematic approaches, research automation platforms, and enterprise
workflows involving sequential AI-driven processes.
