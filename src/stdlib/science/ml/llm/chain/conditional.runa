Conditional Reasoning Chain Logic and Decision Trees

This module provides conditional chain processing for decision-based reasoning
workflows including condition evaluation, branch selection, decision trees,
dynamic routing, probabilistic branching, and adaptive decision-making
strategies for building intelligent AI workflows that respond dynamically
to intermediate results and contextual conditions.

Key Features:
- Dynamic condition evaluation with boolean and fuzzy logic support
- Multi-branch decision trees with nested conditional structures
- Probabilistic branching based on confidence scores and uncertainty
- Context-aware condition evaluation using historical data and patterns
- Dynamic routing based on real-time performance metrics and outcomes
- Conditional step skipping and execution optimization strategies
- Branch prediction and execution path optimization algorithms
- Decision tree learning and adaptation from execution patterns
- Condition dependency tracking and precedence management
- Fallback and default branch handling for unmatched conditions
- Conditional resource allocation and priority-based execution
- Branch merging strategies for convergent execution paths
- Condition validation and consistency checking across branches
- Dynamic condition modification during execution runtime
- Statistical decision making with confidence interval evaluation
- Multi-criteria decision analysis for complex conditional logic
- Conditional error handling and recovery path selection
- Branch performance monitoring and execution time analysis
- Condition template libraries and reusable decision patterns
- Interactive condition evaluation with human-in-the-loop decisions
- Conditional chain composition and nested decision structures
- Machine learning-based condition optimization and refinement
- Condition debugging and execution path visualization tools
- Branch caching and memoization for repeated decision patterns

Physical Foundation:
Based on decision theory, boolean algebra, and control flow concepts from
computer science. Incorporates fuzzy logic principles, probabilistic
reasoning from statistics, and decision tree algorithms from machine
learning for sophisticated conditional evaluation and branch selection.

Applications:
Essential for adaptive AI systems, intelligent automation platforms,
and context-aware applications. Critical for expert systems, diagnostic
tools, and decision support systems requiring dynamic workflow routing
based on intermediate results and environmental conditions.
