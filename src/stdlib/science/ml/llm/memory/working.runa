Working Memory and Active Information Processing

This module provides comprehensive working memory capabilities for AI systems
including active information maintenance, attention control, cognitive load
management, multi-tasking coordination, temporary storage systems, and
dynamic information processing for building AI systems that can effectively
manage and manipulate information during active cognitive tasks.

Key Features:
- Active information maintenance with dynamic capacity management
- Attention control mechanisms for selective information processing
- Cognitive load monitoring and management for optimal performance
- Multi-tasking coordination with resource allocation and task switching
- Temporary storage systems with configurable retention policies
- Information rehearsal and refreshing to maintain active content
- Working memory consolidation with long-term memory integration
- Interference resolution for competing information and task demands
- Priority-based information management with importance-driven retention
- Chunking and organization strategies for efficient information handling
- Working memory span optimization for different task requirements
- Real-time information updating and dynamic content modification
- Attention switching and focus management across concurrent tasks
- Working memory performance monitoring and capacity optimization
- Context switching support with state preservation and restoration
- Information decay modeling with time-based retention characteristics
- Working memory debugging and introspection tools for development
- Adaptive capacity allocation based on task complexity and demands
- Integration with episodic and semantic memory for comprehensive processing
- Working memory templates and patterns for common cognitive operations
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification in active processing
- Working memory security and isolation for sensitive information processing
- Collaborative working memory for multi-agent cognitive coordination
- Working memory compression techniques for efficient information storage

Physical Foundation:
Based on cognitive psychology models of human working memory, including
Baddeley's multi-component model and theories of attention and cognitive
control. Incorporates computational models of attention, resource allocation
algorithms, and memory management principles from computer systems.

Applications:
Essential for complex reasoning tasks, multi-step problem solving, and
interactive AI systems. Critical for conversational agents, planning
systems, mathematical reasoning, and any application requiring active
manipulation and coordination of information during cognitive processing.
