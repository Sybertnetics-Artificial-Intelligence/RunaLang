LLM Embedding Model Fine-Tuning and Adaptation

This module provides comprehensive fine-tuning capabilities specifically
for embedding models used in Large Language Model applications. Includes
contrastive learning, domain adaptation, multilingual alignment, and
specialized training techniques for optimizing embeddings for semantic
search, retrieval, and downstream LLM tasks with focus on semantic
quality and task-specific performance.

Key Features:
- Contrastive learning for embedding optimization
- Domain-specific embedding adaptation
- Multilingual embedding alignment
- Task-specific fine-tuning strategies
- Hard negative mining and sample selection
- Embedding space regularization techniques
- Cross-modal embedding alignment
- Continual learning for embedding models
- Meta-learning for few-shot adaptation
- Evaluation-driven optimization

Physical Foundation:
Based on representation learning theory, contrastive learning principles,
and metric learning foundations. Incorporates optimization theory for
embedding spaces, geometric deep learning, and statistical learning
theory for embedding model generalization and adaptation.

Applications:
Essential for optimizing embeddings for specific domains, tasks, or
languages. Critical for building high-quality semantic search systems,
improving retrieval performance, and adapting pre-trained embedding
models to specialized applications and domains.
