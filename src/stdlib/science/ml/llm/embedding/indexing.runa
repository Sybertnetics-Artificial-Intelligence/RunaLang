LLM Vector Database Operations and Embedding Indexing

This module provides comprehensive vector database operations specifically
optimized for Large Language Model embeddings. Includes high-performance
indexing algorithms, distributed vector storage, and efficient retrieval
systems designed for semantic search and RAG applications with massive
embedding collections and real-time query requirements.

Key Features:
- High-dimensional vector indexing (HNSW, IVF, LSH implementations)
- Distributed vector database architecture
- Real-time embedding insertion and updates
- Approximate and exact nearest neighbor search
- Hybrid dense-sparse vector support
- Multi-modal embedding indexing
- Vector compression and quantization for storage
- Metadata filtering and hybrid search capabilities
- Batch operations and bulk loading
- Index optimization and maintenance

Physical Foundation:
Based on computational geometry, graph theory for navigable small world
networks, locality-sensitive hashing principles, and distributed systems
architecture. Incorporates space partitioning algorithms, dimensionality
reduction techniques, and parallel processing for scalable vector operations.

Applications:
Essential for building RAG systems, semantic search engines, content
recommendation, similar document retrieval, and large-scale embedding
applications. Critical for production LLM systems requiring fast similarity
search over millions of high-dimensional vectors.
