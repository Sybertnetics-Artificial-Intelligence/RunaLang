Note:
LLM Embedding Similarity and Semantic Search

This module provides comprehensive similarity computation and clustering
capabilities specifically optimized for Large Language Model embeddings.
Includes advanced similarity metrics, semantic clustering algorithms, and
efficient similarity search methods tailored for high-dimensional LLM
embedding spaces with optimizations for semantic coherence and scalability.

Key Features:
- Advanced similarity metrics beyond cosine similarity
- Semantic clustering with LLM-aware distance functions  
- Contextual similarity that considers token positions
- Multi-scale similarity analysis (token, sentence, document level)
- Similarity search with semantic ranking
- Cross-modal similarity computation
- Hierarchical clustering for embedding organization
- Similarity-based deduplication and content analysis
- Attention-weighted similarity metrics
- Temporal similarity for conversation analysis

Physical Foundation:
Based on high-dimensional geometry, information theory, and statistical
clustering principles. Incorporates vector space mathematics, manifold
learning theory, and semantic distance metrics for optimal similarity
computation in transformer embedding spaces.

Applications:
Essential for semantic search systems, content recommendation, duplicate
detection, clustering analysis, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Critical for building similarity-based LLM applications, content organization,
and semantic analysis of large text corpora.
