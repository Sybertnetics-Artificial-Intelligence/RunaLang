LLM Embedding-Based Retrieval and RAG Systems

This module provides comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
capabilities and embedding-based retrieval systems optimized for Large
Language Models. Includes dense retrieval, hybrid search, multi-hop
reasoning, and advanced RAG architectures with sophisticated relevance
scoring and context optimization for production LLM applications.

Key Features:
- Dense retrieval with learned query encoders
- Hybrid dense-sparse retrieval systems
- Multi-hop retrieval for complex reasoning
- RAG pipeline orchestration and optimization
- Context window management and optimization
- Relevance scoring and re-ranking systems
- Query expansion and reformulation
- Retrieval result fusion and aggregation
- Dynamic retrieval strategies
- Real-time retrieval with caching

Physical Foundation:
Based on information retrieval theory, probabilistic ranking models,
and neural information processing. Incorporates learning-to-rank
algorithms, attention mechanisms for relevance, and optimization
theory for retrieval pipeline efficiency.

Applications:
Essential for building RAG systems, question-answering applications,
knowledge-grounded dialogue systems, and document retrieval. Critical
for LLM applications requiring external knowledge integration, factual
grounding, and contextual information retrieval.
