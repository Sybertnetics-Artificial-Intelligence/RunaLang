Note:
LLM Embedding Generation and Text Representation

This module provides comprehensive text and multimodal embedding generation
specifically designed for Large Language Models. Includes tokenizer implementations
from scratch, positional encoding schemes, and multimodal embedding fusion
capabilities for building LLM systems that can process text, code, and other
modalities with high semantic fidelity.

Key Features:
- Custom tokenizer implementation (BPE, SentencePiece, WordPiece from scratch)
- Advanced positional encoding (RoPE, ALiBi, learned positions)
- Subword tokenization with vocabulary learning
- Multimodal embedding generation for vision, audio, and code
- Context-aware embedding adaptation
- Efficient tokenization for long sequences
- Custom vocabulary building and optimization
- Token-level and sequence-level representations
- Embedding compression and quantization
- Cross-lingual embedding alignment

Physical Foundation:
Based on information theory principles for optimal encoding, statistical
linguistics for subword segmentation, and distributed representation theory.
Incorporates compression algorithms, hash-based encoding, and geometric
embedding space optimization for semantic preservation.

Applications:
Essential for LLM training and fine-tuning, text preprocessing pipelines,
multimodal model development, and semantic search systems. Critical for
building tokenizers from scratch, creating custom vocabularies, and
generating high-quality embeddings for downstream LLM tasks.
