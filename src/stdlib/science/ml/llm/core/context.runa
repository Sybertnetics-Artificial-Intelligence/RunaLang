Intelligent Context Window and Memory Management

This module provides sophisticated context window management for language models
including dynamic token counting, intelligent truncation strategies, context
compression, conversation history management, and adaptive memory systems for
optimal utilization of model context limits while preserving conversation
coherence and important information across extended interactions.

Key Features:
- Dynamic context window sizing with model-specific optimizations
- Intelligent truncation strategies preserving conversation coherence
- Context compression techniques maintaining semantic information density
- Sliding window management with configurable retention policies  
- Importance-based message filtering and prioritization systems
- Conversation summarization for long-term memory preservation
- Token-accurate counting with provider-specific encoding support
- Context fragmentation and reassembly for large document processing
- Adaptive context allocation balancing prompt and completion space
- Multi-turn conversation state management and history tracking
- Context injection strategies for maintaining system instructions
- Memory hierarchy with short-term, working, and long-term storage
- Context templates and structured prompt management systems
- Dynamic context expansion and contraction based on requirements
- Context validation and integrity checking across model boundaries
- Conversation branching and merging for complex interaction flows
- Context metadata tracking for debugging and optimization
- Semantic similarity-based context retrieval and relevance scoring
- Context preprocessing and postprocessing pipeline management
- Contextual embedding and vector-based memory integration
- Context sharing and synchronization across multiple agents
- Privacy-aware context filtering and sensitive information handling
- Context performance monitoring and optimization recommendations
- Fallback strategies for context overflow and recovery scenarios

Physical Foundation:
Based on information theory principles for optimal data compression and
retention, cognitive science models of human memory systems, and computational
linguistics approaches to discourse coherence. Incorporates algorithmic
information theory for context efficiency and neural network architectures
for semantic understanding and importance scoring.

Applications:
Essential for chatbot systems, AI assistants, and conversational AI platforms
requiring extended interactions. Critical for document analysis systems,
multi-turn reasoning applications, and enterprise AI solutions handling
complex conversations with historical context dependencies.
