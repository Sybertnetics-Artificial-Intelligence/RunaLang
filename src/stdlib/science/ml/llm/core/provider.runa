Provider-Specific LLM Implementations and Adapters

This module provides provider-specific implementations for major LLM providers
including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, and custom deployments with
standardized interfaces, authentication management, request/response mapping,
error handling, and provider-specific optimization strategies for seamless
integration across diverse LLM ecosystems.

Key Features:
- Unified provider abstraction layer with consistent API interfaces
- Provider-specific authentication and credential management systems
- Request format translation between standard and provider schemas
- Response normalization and error code standardization across providers
- Provider capability detection and feature flag management
- Rate limiting and quota management tailored to provider constraints
- Cost calculation with provider-specific pricing models and billing
- Provider health monitoring and availability status tracking
- Custom deployment support for private and self-hosted models
- Multi-region endpoint management with geographic load balancing
- Provider-specific optimization strategies and performance tuning
- Streaming response handling adapted to provider implementations
- Function calling support with provider-specific format conversion
- Multi-modal input handling for vision and audio capable providers
- Provider failover and backup endpoint configuration management
- Authentication refresh and token lifecycle management
- Provider-specific retry strategies and exponential backoff policies
- Model version management and backward compatibility support
- Custom header and parameter injection for enterprise deployments
- Provider analytics and usage tracking with detailed reporting
- Compliance and audit logging for enterprise security requirements
- Dynamic provider discovery and automatic configuration updates
- Provider-specific batching and request optimization strategies
- Error classification and provider-specific troubleshooting guidance

Physical Foundation:
Based on software engineering principles including adapter pattern, factory
pattern, and strategy pattern for provider abstraction. Incorporates network
programming concepts for HTTP client management, authentication protocols
for secure API access, and distributed systems patterns for reliability
and fault tolerance across multiple provider endpoints.

Applications:
Essential for multi-provider LLM applications, AI orchestration platforms,
and enterprise systems requiring vendor flexibility. Critical for production
AI services, research platforms comparing models, and applications requiring
high availability through provider diversification and intelligent failover.
