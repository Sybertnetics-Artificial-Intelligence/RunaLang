Real-time Streaming Response Management

This module provides comprehensive streaming response handling for language models
including real-time token processing, backpressure management, stream buffering,
incremental response assembly, connection resilience, and adaptive streaming
strategies for optimal user experience in interactive applications requiring
immediate feedback and low-latency communication with language models.

Key Features:
- Real-time token-by-token streaming with minimal latency overhead
- Adaptive backpressure management preventing buffer overflow conditions
- Stream buffering and batching strategies for optimal network utilization
- Incremental response assembly with proper UTF-8 character handling
- Connection resilience with automatic reconnection and stream recovery
- Multi-stream management for concurrent conversation handling
- Stream multiplexing and demultiplexing for efficient resource usage
- Stream quality monitoring with latency and throughput metrics
- Configurable buffering strategies balancing latency and reliability
- Stream compression and decompression for bandwidth optimization
- Error detection and correction in streaming data transmission
- Stream synchronization and ordering for multi-part responses
- Adaptive streaming rates based on network conditions and capacity
- Stream encryption and security for protected communication channels
- Stream analytics and performance monitoring with detailed reporting
- Custom stream processors for specialized response transformation
- Stream caching and replay capabilities for debugging and analysis
- Rate limiting and throttling controls for stream management
- Stream health monitoring with automatic fallback mechanisms
- Streaming response validation and integrity checking
- Stream metadata tracking and enrichment throughout pipeline
- Bi-directional streaming support for interactive conversations
- Stream aggregation and summarization for long-running responses  
- Stream branching and merging for complex interaction patterns

Physical Foundation:
Based on network programming principles including TCP/UDP protocols,
flow control algorithms, and buffering strategies. Incorporates real-time
systems concepts for latency minimization, signal processing techniques
for stream management, and distributed systems patterns for reliability
and fault tolerance in streaming architectures.

Applications:
Essential for interactive chatbot interfaces, real-time AI assistants,
and live content generation systems. Critical for streaming APIs,
conversational AI platforms, and applications requiring immediate
user feedback with progressive response delivery and minimal latency.
