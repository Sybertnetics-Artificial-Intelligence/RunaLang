Intelligent Model Selection and Routing

This module provides intelligent routing and selection of language models
based on task requirements, performance characteristics, cost constraints,
and availability with dynamic load balancing, failover mechanisms, and
optimization strategies for efficient LLM resource utilization.

Key Features:
- Dynamic model selection based on task complexity and requirements
- Cost-optimized routing with budget constraints and pricing awareness
- Performance-based routing using latency and throughput metrics
- Load balancing across multiple model instances and providers
- Intelligent failover with automatic fallback to alternative models
- Capability-based routing matching tasks to model strengths
- Geographic routing for latency optimization and data residency
- A/B testing framework for comparing model performance
- Adaptive routing with machine learning-based optimization
- Rate limit aware routing to prevent API throttling
- Quality-based routing using confidence scores and validation
- Multi-criteria decision making for optimal model selection
- Circuit breaker patterns for handling model failures
- Routing analytics and performance monitoring
- Custom routing rules engine with configurable strategies

Physical Foundation:
Based on distributed systems principles including load balancing algorithms,
consensus mechanisms, and fault tolerance patterns. Incorporates optimization
theory for multi-objective decision making, queueing theory for performance
modeling, and control theory for adaptive system behavior.

Applications:
Essential for production LLM systems, AI orchestration platforms, and
multi-model applications. Critical for cost-effective AI deployments,
high-availability chatbot systems, and enterprise AI solutions requiring
optimal resource utilization and service reliability.
