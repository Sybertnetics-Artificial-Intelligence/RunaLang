Unified LLM Interface and Model Abstraction

This module provides a unified interface for interacting with large language
models across different providers, with model abstraction, capability detection,
request standardization, token management, and cost estimation for seamless
integration and provider-agnostic LLM orchestration systems.

Key Features:
- Abstract base interface for all LLM providers with consistent API
- Model capability detection and feature flag management
- Request/response standardization across different LLM providers
- Token counting and cost estimation with provider-specific pricing
- Model parameter configuration with validation and constraints
- Streaming and non-streaming response handling abstraction
- Error handling and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting and quota management across providers
- Model metadata management including context limits and capabilities
- Input/output validation with schema enforcement
- Model versioning and backward compatibility support
- Performance metrics collection and monitoring
- Multi-modal support for text, image, and audio inputs
- Custom model integration framework for private deployments
- Provider failover and load balancing capabilities

Physical Foundation:
Based on software engineering principles of abstraction and polymorphism
with interface segregation and dependency inversion. Incorporates distributed
systems patterns for reliability, observability principles for monitoring,
and API design best practices for consistent developer experience.

Applications:
Essential for AI application development, chatbot systems, content generation
platforms, and automated reasoning systems. Critical for building scalable
LLM-powered applications, research platforms, and enterprise AI solutions
requiring provider flexibility and operational reliability.
