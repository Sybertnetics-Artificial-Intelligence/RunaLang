Domain Adaptation Techniques for Large Language Models

This module provides comprehensive domain adaptation capabilities for Large
Language Models, enabling effective transfer from general domains to specialized
areas. Implements continual learning, few-shot domain adaptation, cross-domain
transfer learning, and advanced techniques for maintaining general capabilities
while acquiring domain-specific knowledge and skills.

Key Features:
- Continual learning without catastrophic forgetting
- Few-shot domain adaptation with minimal examples
- Cross-domain transfer learning optimization
- Domain-specific vocabulary expansion and integration
- Elastic weight consolidation and memory replay
- Progressive domain specialization strategies
- Multi-domain learning and task routing
- Domain drift detection and adaptation
- Knowledge preservation and selective updating
- Domain-aware evaluation and benchmarking

Physical Foundation:
Based on transfer learning theory, continual learning principles, and
domain adaptation mathematics. Incorporates regularization theory for
preventing forgetting, meta-learning for rapid adaptation, and
optimization theory for balancing multiple learning objectives.

Applications:
Essential for specialized LLM deployment in healthcare, legal, finance,
science, and technical domains. Critical for building domain experts
while maintaining general capabilities, enabling rapid customization,
and creating robust models that work across multiple specialized areas.
