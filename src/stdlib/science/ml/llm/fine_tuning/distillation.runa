Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models

This module provides comprehensive knowledge distillation capabilities
specifically designed for Large Language Models. Implements teacher-student
architectures, progressive distillation chains, feature-level distillation,
and advanced compression techniques for creating efficient, smaller models
that retain much of the performance of larger teacher models.

Key Features:
- Complete teacher-student distillation framework
- Progressive distillation chains for gradual compression
- Layer-wise and feature-level knowledge transfer
- Task-specific distillation optimization
- Multi-teacher distillation from ensemble models
- Self-distillation for model refinement
- Attention transfer and representation alignment
- Dynamic distillation with adaptive loss weighting
- Structured pruning integration with distillation
- Cross-modal distillation for multimodal models

Physical Foundation:
Based on information theory for knowledge compression, statistical learning
theory for generalization bounds, and representation learning for feature
transfer. Incorporates optimization theory for multi-objective learning,
approximation theory for model compression, and transfer learning principles.

Applications:
Essential for model compression, edge deployment, inference acceleration,
and resource-constrained environments. Critical for democratizing large
model capabilities, reducing computational costs, and enabling efficient
deployment of powerful language models in production systems.
