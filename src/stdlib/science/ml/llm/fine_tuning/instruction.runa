Instruction Following Fine-Tuning for LLMs

This module provides comprehensive instruction following fine-tuning capabilities
for Large Language Models. Implements instruction dataset creation, self-instruct
methodologies, instruction-response pair curation, and multi-task instruction
tuning with sophisticated techniques for building models that excel at following
human instructions across diverse tasks and domains.

Key Features:
- Self-instruct data generation and bootstrapping
- Instruction-response pair curation and quality control
- Multi-task instruction dataset construction
- Constitutional instruction following training
- Chain-of-thought instruction integration
- Few-shot instruction learning and adaptation
- Instruction complexity progression and curriculum
- Cross-lingual instruction following capabilities
- Domain-specific instruction specialization
- Instruction evaluation and quality assessment

Physical Foundation:
Based on natural language understanding, pragmatics theory for instruction
interpretation, and multi-task learning principles. Incorporates curriculum
learning theory, meta-learning for instruction generalization, and
reinforcement learning for instruction following optimization.

Applications:
Essential for building general-purpose AI assistants, task-specific chatbots,
educational AI systems, and automated instruction-following agents. Critical
for creating LLMs that can understand and execute complex human instructions
across diverse domains with high fidelity and safety.
