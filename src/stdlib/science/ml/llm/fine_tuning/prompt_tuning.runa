Soft Prompt Optimization and Prompt Tuning for LLMs

This module provides comprehensive soft prompt optimization and prompt tuning
capabilities for Large Language Models. Implements learnable soft prompts,
prefix tuning, P-tuning variants, and advanced prompt optimization techniques
that enable task-specific adaptation through learnable prompt parameters
while keeping the base model frozen for efficient customization.

Key Features:
- Soft prompt initialization and optimization
- Prefix tuning with learnable key-value pairs
- P-tuning v2 with cross-layer prompt parameters
- Prompt ensemble and multi-prompt strategies
- Task-specific prompt generation and adaptation
- Continuous prompt learning and meta-learning
- Prompt compression and efficiency optimization
- Multi-modal prompt tuning for vision-language models
- Adversarial prompt optimization and robustness
- Prompt interpretability and analysis tools

Physical Foundation:
Based on continuous optimization in embedding spaces, gradient-based
learning for discrete prompts, and representation learning theory.
Incorporates differential programming concepts, embedding geometry,
and optimization theory for learnable prompt parameters.

Applications:
Essential for parameter-efficient LLM adaptation, task-specific customization,
few-shot learning enhancement, and resource-constrained fine-tuning. Critical
for rapid task adaptation, personalization, and building specialized LLM
applications without full model fine-tuning overhead.
