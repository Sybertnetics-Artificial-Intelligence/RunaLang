RLHF and Constitutional AI Training for LLMs

This module provides comprehensive Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and Constitutional AI implementation for Large Language Models. Includes
PPO training, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), reward modeling, and
constitutional AI training loops with sophisticated human preference learning
and value alignment optimization for safe and helpful AI systems.

Key Features:
- Complete RLHF pipeline with PPO implementation
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and variants
- Reward model training and calibration
- Constitutional AI training with principle-based learning
- Human preference collection and modeling
- Multi-objective reward optimization
- Online and offline preference learning
- Rejection sampling fine-tuning (RAFT)
- Reward hacking detection and mitigation
- Value alignment and safety optimization

Physical Foundation:
Based on reinforcement learning theory, game theory for multi-agent
optimization, and decision theory for preference modeling. Incorporates
policy gradient methods, value function approximation, and mechanism
design for preference elicitation and aggregation.

Applications:
Essential for creating helpful, harmless, and honest AI assistants,
building value-aligned language models, and implementing safety measures
through human feedback. Critical for responsible AI deployment, preference
learning, and creating AI systems aligned with human values and intentions.
