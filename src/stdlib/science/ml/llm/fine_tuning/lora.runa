LoRA Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for LLMs

This module provides comprehensive Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) implementation
for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models. Includes LoRA,
QLoRA, and advanced variants with dynamic rank selection, multi-LoRA
composition, and efficient training strategies specifically designed for
LLM adaptation with minimal computational overhead and memory requirements.

Key Features:
- Complete LoRA implementation from scratch
- QLoRA with quantization-aware adaptation
- Dynamic rank selection and optimization
- Multi-LoRA composition and merging techniques
- AdaLoRA with adaptive rank allocation
- DoRA (Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation)
- LoRA+ with improved learning rate optimization
- Efficient gradient computation and memory management
- Task-specific LoRA routing and selection
- Continual learning with LoRA chains

Physical Foundation:
Based on matrix decomposition theory, low-rank approximation mathematics,
and optimization theory for constrained parameter updates. Incorporates
singular value decomposition, gradient flow analysis, and efficient
backpropagation for reduced-parameter training systems.

Applications:
Essential for efficient LLM fine-tuning, domain adaptation, task-specific
customization, and resource-constrained training scenarios. Critical for
democratizing LLM fine-tuning, enabling rapid model adaptation, and
reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance.
