LLM Network Pruning and Sparsification

This module provides comprehensive network pruning and sparsification
techniques specifically designed for Large Language Models. Implements
structured and unstructured pruning, magnitude-based and gradient-based
pruning, lottery ticket hypothesis testing, and advanced sparsification
methods for dramatic model compression while preserving performance.

Key Features:
- Complete structured and unstructured pruning implementation
- Magnitude-based iterative pruning with various schedules
- Gradient-based pruning using fisher information and SNIP
- Lottery ticket hypothesis implementation and analysis
- Movement pruning during training
- Layer-wise and global pruning strategies
- Attention head and FFN neuron pruning
- Dynamic sparsity patterns and adaptive pruning
- Pruning-aware training and fine-tuning
- Hardware-efficient sparse model formats

Physical Foundation:
Based on neural network compression theory, information theory for
redundancy analysis, and optimization theory for sparse learning.
Incorporates lottery ticket theory, magnitude-based importance scoring,
and gradient-based saliency measures for optimal pruning decisions.

Applications:
Essential for model compression, edge deployment, inference acceleration,
and memory-constrained environments. Critical for creating efficient
LLM variants, reducing computational overhead, and enabling deployment
on resource-limited hardware while maintaining model capabilities.
