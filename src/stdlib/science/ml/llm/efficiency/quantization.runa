Note:
LLM Model Quantization and Compression

This module provides comprehensive quantization and compression techniques
specifically designed for Large Language Models. Implements advanced
quantization methods including INT8, INT4, mixed-precision approaches,
and LLM-specific optimizations for dramatic model compression while
maintaining high performance and quality in inference and deployment.

Key Features:
- Complete INT8/INT4 quantization implementation from scratch
- Mixed-precision quantization with optimal bit allocation
- Activation quantization with calibration datasets
- Weight quantization with outlier-aware methods
- Dynamic quantization for inference optimization
- Quantization-aware training (QAT) for LLMs
- Post-training quantization (PTQ) with minimal quality loss
- LLM-specific quantization techniques (GPTQ, AWQ, SmoothQuant)
- Quantized attention and FFN layer implementations
- Hardware-specific quantization optimization

Physical Foundation:
Based on information theory for optimal quantization, signal processing
for quantization error analysis, and numerical analysis for precision
management. Incorporates optimization theory for bit allocation,
approximation theory for compression bounds, and statistical analysis
for calibration dataset selection.

Applications:
Essential for LLM deployment on resource-constrained hardware, edge
computing, mobile devices, and cost-effective serving. Critical for
reducing memory footprint, accelerating inference, and enabling
widespread deployment of powerful language models with minimal
hardware requirements.
