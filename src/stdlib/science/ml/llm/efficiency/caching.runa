LLM Response Caching and Memoization Systems

This module provides comprehensive caching and memoization capabilities
specifically designed for Large Language Model systems. Implements semantic
caching, KV-cache optimization, response memoization, and intelligent
caching strategies that dramatically improve inference efficiency and
reduce computational overhead for repeated or similar queries.

Key Features:
- KV-cache optimization and management for transformer models
- Semantic caching for similar query detection and response reuse
- Response memoization with configurable similarity thresholds
- Cross-request cache sharing and coordination
- Hierarchical caching with multiple cache levels
- Cache invalidation and freshness management
- Distributed caching for multi-node deployments
- Memory-efficient cache compression techniques
- Cache warming and precomputation strategies
- Intelligent cache eviction policies

Physical Foundation:
Based on cache theory from computer systems, information retrieval
for semantic similarity, and distributed systems principles for
cache consistency. Incorporates locality theory, working set models,
and semantic similarity metrics for optimal cache performance.

Applications:
Essential for production LLM deployments, high-throughput serving,
cost optimization, and latency reduction. Critical for building
scalable LLM services, improving user experience through faster
responses, and reducing computational costs in production systems.
