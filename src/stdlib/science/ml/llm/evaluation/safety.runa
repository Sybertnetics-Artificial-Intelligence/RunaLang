Note:
LLM Safety Evaluation and Alignment Assessment

This module provides comprehensive safety evaluation and alignment assessment
capabilities for Large Language Models. Implements systematic approaches to
evaluate model safety, harmlessness, helpfulness, and alignment with human
values through robust testing frameworks, constitutional AI assessment, and
comprehensive safety measurement methodologies for responsible AI deployment.

Key Features:
- Constitutional AI compliance and alignment evaluation
- Harm detection and prevention assessment systems
- Safety guideline adherence measurement
- Value alignment and ethical behavior evaluation
- Helpfulness and harmlessness balance assessment
- Content safety classification and filtering evaluation
- Red teaming coordination for safety testing
- Long-term safety and capability monitoring
- Human preference alignment measurement
- Safety-performance trade-off analysis

Physical Foundation:
Based on moral philosophy, decision theory for value alignment, and
safety engineering principles. Incorporates game theory for adversarial
safety testing, utility theory for preference modeling, and risk assessment
methodologies from safety-critical systems engineering.

Applications:
Essential for responsible LLM deployment, safety validation, regulatory
compliance, and risk management. Critical for ensuring AI systems behave
safely and beneficially, align with human values, and maintain safety
properties under diverse conditions and adversarial scenarios.
