Note:
LLM Standard Benchmark Execution and Management

This module provides comprehensive benchmark execution capabilities for
Large Language Models, including implementation and management of standard
benchmarks like MMLU, HellaSwag, HumanEval, and custom benchmark creation.
Handles automated benchmark running, result analysis, and comparative
evaluation with robust infrastructure for reproducible LLM assessment.

Key Features:
- Standard benchmark implementations (MMLU, HellaSwag, HumanEval, BBH)
- Custom benchmark framework and creation tools
- Automated benchmark execution and orchestration
- Result analysis and comparative evaluation
- Benchmark versioning and reproducibility
- Multi-domain evaluation across reasoning, knowledge, coding
- Leaderboard generation and ranking systems
- Statistical analysis and significance testing
- Benchmark contamination detection
- Performance profiling and efficiency measurement

Physical Foundation:
Based on psychometric testing theory, statistical evaluation methods,
and measurement theory for cognitive assessment. Incorporates item
response theory, reliability analysis, and validity measurement for
robust benchmark design and interpretation.

Applications:
Essential for LLM evaluation, model comparison, progress tracking,
and research validation. Critical for establishing model capabilities,
identifying strengths and weaknesses, and providing standardized
evaluation across different LLM systems and research groups.
