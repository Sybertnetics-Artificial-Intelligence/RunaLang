Note:
Adversarial Testing and Robustness Evaluation for LLMs

This module provides comprehensive adversarial testing capabilities for
Large Language Models, including jailbreak detection, robustness evaluation,
and security assessment. Implements attack generation, defense testing, and
robustness measurement techniques specifically designed for LLM security
and reliability evaluation with focus on real-world adversarial scenarios.

Key Features:
- Jailbreak attack generation and detection
- Prompt injection vulnerability testing
- Robustness evaluation against input perturbations
- Adversarial example generation for text
- Red team testing automation and coordination
- Security vulnerability scanning and assessment
- Backdoor and trojan detection in models
- Stress testing under extreme conditions
- Social engineering attack simulation
- Comprehensive adversarial attack taxonomies

Physical Foundation:
Based on adversarial machine learning theory, game theory for attack-defense
dynamics, and robustness analysis from control theory. Incorporates
optimization methods for attack generation, statistical robustness measures,
and security evaluation frameworks from cybersecurity research.

Applications:
Essential for LLM security assessment, robustness validation, safety testing,
and defense mechanism evaluation. Critical for identifying vulnerabilities,
testing model reliability under attack, and ensuring safe deployment of
LLM systems in adversarial environments and security-critical applications.
