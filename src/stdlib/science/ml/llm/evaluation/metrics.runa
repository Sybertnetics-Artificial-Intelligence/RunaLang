LLM Evaluation Metrics and Quality Assessment

This module provides comprehensive evaluation metrics specifically designed
for Large Language Models, including traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE,
modern LLM-specific metrics, and advanced quality assessments. Implements
metrics from scratch with optimizations for LLM evaluation, factuality
assessment, and semantic coherence measurement for robust model evaluation.

Key Features:
- Traditional NLP metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr) from scratch
- Modern LLM metrics (BERTScore, BLEURT, factuality scores)
- Semantic coherence and consistency metrics
- Hallucination detection and measurement
- Toxicity and safety evaluation metrics
- Code generation evaluation (CodeBLEU, execution-based)
- Conversational quality metrics
- Calibration and uncertainty quantification
- Multi-modal evaluation metrics
- Custom metric framework for specialized evaluation

Physical Foundation:
Based on information theory for sequence comparison, statistical linguistics
for semantic similarity, and probabilistic models for quality assessment.
Incorporates n-gram statistics, semantic similarity computation, and
machine learning-based evaluation for comprehensive quality measurement.

Applications:
Essential for LLM development, model comparison, fine-tuning evaluation,
and production monitoring. Critical for assessing generation quality,
safety, factuality, and overall model performance across diverse tasks
and domains for research and production LLM systems.
