Human Evaluation Frameworks for LLMs

This module provides comprehensive human evaluation capabilities for Large
Language Models, including preference collection, quality assessment interfaces,
crowdsourcing coordination, and human-AI collaboration evaluation. Implements
robust methodologies for collecting human judgments, managing annotation
workflows, and analyzing human-model agreement for reliable LLM evaluation.

Key Features:
- Human preference collection and ranking interfaces
- Quality assessment frameworks with detailed rubrics
- Crowdsourcing platform integration and management
- Inter-annotator agreement analysis and quality control
- Active learning for efficient human annotation
- Comparative evaluation and A/B testing interfaces
- Expert evaluation coordination and specialized assessment
- Bias detection in human annotations
- Human-AI collaboration evaluation metrics
- Longitudinal evaluation and temporal analysis

Physical Foundation:
Based on psychometric theory, measurement science, and human-computer
interaction principles. Incorporates statistical methods for reliability
analysis, cognitive psychology for task design, and social science
methods for bias detection and quality assessment.

Applications:
Essential for LLM development, model comparison, fine-tuning validation,
and establishing ground truth for automatic metrics. Critical for
understanding human preferences, quality dimensions, and developing
human-aligned AI systems through comprehensive human feedback collection.
