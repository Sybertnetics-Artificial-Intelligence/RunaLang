Note:
LLM Bias Detection and Fairness Evaluation

This module provides comprehensive bias detection and fairness evaluation
capabilities specifically designed for Large Language Models. Implements
systematic approaches to identify, measure, and analyze various forms of
bias including demographic, cultural, and representation biases with
sophisticated measurement techniques and mitigation assessment frameworks.

Key Features:
- Multi-dimensional bias detection across protected attributes
- Cultural and linguistic bias identification
- Representation bias analysis in generated content  
- Intersectional bias evaluation and measurement
- Stereotype detection and quantification systems
- Historical bias reproduction analysis
- Fairness metric computation and benchmarking
- Bias mitigation effectiveness evaluation
- Cross-cultural bias assessment frameworks
- Temporal bias analysis and trend detection

Physical Foundation:
Based on fairness theory from algorithmic justice, statistical parity
principles, and social science bias measurement methodologies. Incorporates
causal inference methods, statistical independence testing, and equity
measurement frameworks from social justice and ethics research.

Applications:
Essential for responsible AI development, model auditing, fairness validation,
and bias mitigation assessment. Critical for ensuring equitable LLM
deployment, regulatory compliance, and building trustworthy AI systems
that serve diverse populations fairly and without discrimination.
