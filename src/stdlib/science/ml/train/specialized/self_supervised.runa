Self-Supervised Learning Training Methods for Runa

This module implements self-supervised learning algorithms that learn useful
representations from unlabeled data by defining pretext tasks. Provides
contrastive learning, masked language modeling, autoencoding methods, and
advanced self-supervised techniques for representation learning.

Key Features:
- Contrastive learning with SimCLR, MoCo, and SwAV algorithms
- Masked language modeling and autoregressive prediction
- Vision transformers with masked autoencoding (MAE)
- Rotation prediction and jigsaw puzzle solving for vision
- Temporal order verification and next frame prediction
- Bootstrap your own latent (BYOL) and SimSiam methods
- Cluster assignment and pseudo-labeling techniques
- Multi-modal self-supervised learning across data types
- Momentum-based encoders and exponential moving averages
- Negative sampling strategies and hard negative mining
- Self-distillation and knowledge distillation methods
- Curriculum learning with progressive pretext task difficulty
- Semi-supervised learning with consistency regularization
- Representation quality evaluation and downstream task transfer
- Domain-specific pretext tasks for specialized applications

Physical Foundation:
Self-supervised learning exploits the inherent structure and correlations
in natural data to learn meaningful representations without explicit labels.
This involves information-theoretic principles, statistical dependencies,
and invariance properties that capture semantic content.

Applications:
- Natural language processing with large-scale text modeling
- Computer vision with image and video understanding
- Speech processing with acoustic representation learning
- Medical imaging with anatomical structure learning
- Time series analysis with temporal pattern discovery
- Genomics with sequence representation learning
- Robotics with sensorimotor representation learning
