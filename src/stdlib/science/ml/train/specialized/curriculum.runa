Curriculum Learning and Progressive Training Methods for Runa

This module implements curriculum learning algorithms that improve training
efficiency and model performance by presenting training examples in a
meaningful order. Provides difficulty scoring, pacing functions, and
adaptive curriculum strategies for enhanced learning outcomes.

Key Features:
- Difficulty assessment and example scoring mechanisms
- Static curriculum design with predefined difficulty progression
- Dynamic curriculum adaptation based on model performance
- Self-paced learning with automatic difficulty adjustment
- Teacher-student curriculum transfer and knowledge distillation
- Multi-task curriculum learning with task scheduling
- Competence-based progression and mastery thresholds
- Adversarial curriculum generation for robustness training
- Data-driven curriculum discovery from learning dynamics
- Hierarchical curriculum with multi-level difficulty structures
- Curriculum evaluation and effectiveness measurement
- Anti-curriculum learning for exploring failure modes
- Curriculum regularization and overfitting prevention
- Transfer curriculum across domains and tasks
- Human-in-the-loop curriculum design and refinement
 
Physical Foundation:
Curriculum learning is inspired by cognitive science principles of human
learning, particularly the zone of proximal development and scaffolding
theory. This involves gradual complexity increase, cognitive load management,
and optimal challenge progression for efficient skill acquisition.

Applications:
- Natural language processing with progressive text complexity
- Computer vision with image difficulty progression
- Reinforcement learning with environment complexity scheduling
- Speech recognition with acoustic complexity gradation
- Medical imaging with diagnostic difficulty levels
- Educational technology with personalized learning paths
- Robotics with skill acquisition and motor learning
