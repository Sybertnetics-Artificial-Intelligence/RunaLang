Continual Learning and Lifelong Learning Training Methods for Runa

This module implements continual learning algorithms that enable models to learn
continuously from a stream of tasks without forgetting previously learned knowledge.
Provides catastrophic forgetting prevention, knowledge retention strategies,
and lifelong learning frameworks for dynamic environments.

Key Features:
- Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for parameter importance estimation
- Progressive Neural Networks for task-specific capacity expansion
- Memory replay systems with experience buffer management
- Meta-learning approaches for fast adaptation to new tasks
- Regularization-based methods for knowledge preservation
- Dynamic architecture approaches with neural plasticity
- Task boundary detection and automatic task segmentation
- Continual learning benchmarks and evaluation protocols
- Multi-modal continual learning across different data types
- Online learning with streaming data integration
- Forgetting-aware optimization and gradient manipulation
- Knowledge distillation for experience compression
- Rehearsal-free methods and generative replay techniques
- Lifelong reinforcement learning and policy preservation
- Continual domain adaptation and distribution shift handling
Physical Foundation:
Continual learning addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma where neural
systems must maintain previously learned representations while adapting to
new information. This involves synaptic consolidation mechanisms, memory
replay processes, and selective attention for relevant information retention.

Applications:
- Lifelong robotics learning and autonomous system adaptation
- Personalized AI assistants with continuous user adaptation
- Dynamic recommendation systems with evolving preferences
- Medical diagnosis systems with continuous knowledge updates
- Financial modeling with market regime changes
- Natural language processing with vocabulary expansion
- Computer vision with new object category learning
