Active Learning Strategies for Runa
 
This module implements active learning algorithms that intelligently select
the most informative examples for labeling, minimizing annotation costs while
maximizing model performance. Provides query strategies, uncertainty estimation,
and human-in-the-loop learning frameworks for efficient data annotation.

Key Features:
- Uncertainty sampling with entropy and margin-based selection
- Query-by-committee with ensemble disagreement measures
- Expected model change and gradient-based selection strategies
- Diversity-based sampling for representative data coverage
- Batch-mode active learning for efficient annotation rounds
- Pool-based and stream-based active learning scenarios
- Multi-class and multi-label active learning extensions
- Cost-sensitive active learning with variable annotation costs
- Human-in-the-loop integration with annotation interfaces
- Active learning for deep neural networks and large models
- Bayesian active learning with posterior uncertainty
- Semi-supervised active learning with unlabeled data utilization
- Transfer active learning across domains and tasks
- Stopping criteria and budget allocation strategies
- Active learning evaluation metrics and experimental design

Physical Foundation:
Active learning leverages information theory, particularly entropy and
mutual information, to quantify the value of potential training examples.
This involves uncertainty quantification, decision theory, and optimal
experimental design principles for efficient learning with limited labels.

Applications:
- Medical imaging with expert radiologist annotations
- Natural language processing with expensive linguistic annotations
- Computer vision with pixel-level segmentation labeling
- Autonomous driving with safety-critical scenario labeling
- Scientific data analysis with domain expert knowledge
- Content moderation with human reviewer efficiency
- Robotics with demonstration and preference learning
