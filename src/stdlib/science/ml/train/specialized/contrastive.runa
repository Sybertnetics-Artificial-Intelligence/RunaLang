Contrastive Learning Methods for Runa
 
This module implements contrastive learning algorithms that learn representations
by comparing similar and dissimilar examples. Provides various contrastive
frameworks, negative sampling strategies, and representation learning techniques
for unsupervised and self-supervised learning scenarios.

Key Features:
- SimCLR framework with data augmentation and temperature scaling
- MoCo (Momentum Contrast) with momentum-updated encoders
- SwAV (Swapping Assignments between Views) with cluster assignments
- InfoNCE loss and its variants for contrastive optimization
- Hard negative mining and negative sampling strategies
- Multi-view contrastive learning across different modalities
- Supervised contrastive learning with label information
- Instance discrimination and prototype-based contrastive methods
- Temporal contrastive learning for sequential data
- Cross-modal contrastive learning for multi-modal data
- Hierarchical contrastive learning with multi-scale representations
- Contrastive predictive coding for temporal modeling
- Memory bank management for large-scale contrastive learning
- Temperature annealing and adaptive temperature strategies
- Evaluation metrics for contrastive representation quality

Physical Foundation:
Contrastive learning leverages information theory principles, particularly
mutual information maximization between different views of the same data.
This involves noise-contrastive estimation, metric learning, and
representation alignment in high-dimensional embedding spaces.

Applications:
- Computer vision with image representation learning
- Natural language processing with sentence embeddings
- Speech processing with acoustic representation learning
- Time series analysis with temporal pattern discovery
- Graph neural networks with node representation learning
- Multimodal learning with cross-modal alignment
- Medical imaging with anatomical feature learning
