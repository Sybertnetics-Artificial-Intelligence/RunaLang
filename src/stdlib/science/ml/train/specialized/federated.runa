Federated Learning Systems

This module provides federated learning capabilities for machine learning
systems including distributed training coordination, privacy-preserving
aggregation, client management, communication optimization, and secure
computation for building AI systems with robust federated learning that
can train models collaboratively across distributed clients while preserving
data privacy, handling heterogeneous data distributions, and maintaining
system security through systematic federated learning protocols and
intelligent distributed training coordination mechanisms.

Key Features:
- Distributed training coordination managing federated learning across multiple clients
- Privacy-preserving aggregation protecting individual client data during model updates
- Client management handling client selection, scheduling, and lifecycle management
- Communication optimization minimizing bandwidth usage and latency in federated settings
- Secure computation implementing cryptographic protocols for privacy protection
- Differential privacy integration adding noise to protect individual data points
- Homomorphic encryption enabling computation on encrypted model updates
- Secure multi-party computation coordinating privacy-preserving collaborative training
- FedAvg implementation standard federated averaging algorithm for model aggregation
- FedProx algorithm handling statistical and systems heterogeneity in federated learning
- FedNova adaptive federated optimization for non-IID data distributions
- Personalized federated learning adapting global models for individual clients
- Hierarchical federated learning organizing clients in multi-level hierarchies
- Cross-silo federated learning enabling collaboration between organizations
- Cross-device federated learning supporting mobile and IoT device participation
- Asynchronous federated learning handling clients with different update frequencies
- Byzantine-robust federated learning defending against malicious clients
- Non-IID data handling managing heterogeneous data distributions across clients
- Client drift mitigation preventing performance degradation due to local updates
- Adaptive aggregation dynamically weighting client contributions based on quality
- Federated reinforcement learning extending federated learning to RL scenarios
- Federated transfer learning leveraging pre-trained models in federated settings
- Model compression for federated learning reducing communication overhead
- Quantization techniques minimizing communication costs through precision reduction
- Gradient sparsification reducing communication by sending only significant updates
- Client sampling strategies optimizing client selection for training efficiency
- Fault tolerance mechanisms handling client failures and network interruptions
- Federated analytics enabling privacy-preserving data analysis across clients
- Continual federated learning maintaining model performance over time
- Multi-task federated learning training multiple related tasks collaboratively

Physical Foundation:
Based on distributed systems theory, cryptography, and privacy-preserving
computation. Incorporates communication protocols, consensus mechanisms,
and secure aggregation techniques for collaborative machine learning
while maintaining data privacy and security in distributed environments.

Applications:
Essential for healthcare AI, financial services, and mobile applications.
Critical for applications requiring collaborative learning across organizations,
privacy-sensitive data analysis, edge computing scenarios, and distributed
AI systems where data cannot be centrally collected due to privacy constraints.
