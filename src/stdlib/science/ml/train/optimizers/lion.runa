Lion Optimizer Module for Scientific Computing

This module provides comprehensive Lion (EvoLved Sign Momentum) optimization
capabilities for machine learning model training. Covers Lion optimizer,
Lion variants, and sign-based momentum methods. Essential for memory-efficient
optimization with improved convergence, robustness to hyperparameters, and
stable training dynamics for professional ML systems.

Key Features:
- Complete Lion optimizer implementation with sign-based momentum updates
- Memory-efficient optimization requiring only momentum state (no second moment)
- Robust hyperparameter selection with wide effective learning rate ranges
- Improved convergence on large-scale models and datasets
- Lion variants including LionW with decoupled weight decay
- Adaptive Lion with dynamic hyperparameter adjustment
- Distributed Lion with gradient synchronization and state management
- Integration with learning rate scheduling and gradient preprocessing

Implements the state-of-the-art Lion optimizer from Google Research/Meta AI,
providing superior performance on large models while using significantly
less memory than Adam-family optimizers for professional ML applications.
