Adversarial Example Detection

This module provides adversarial example detection capabilities for machine
learning systems including statistical detection methods, neural network
detectors, anomaly detection, input analysis, and real-time screening for
building AI systems with robust adversarial detection that can identify
potentially malicious inputs, distinguish adversarial examples from natural
inputs, and provide early warning systems against adversarial attacks through
comprehensive detection mechanisms and intelligent screening algorithms.

Key Features:
- Statistical detection methods using distributional analysis for adversarial identification
- Neural network detectors employing deep learning for adversarial example classification
- Anomaly detection techniques identifying inputs that deviate from normal patterns
- Input analysis methods examining structural and semantic properties of inputs
- Real-time screening enabling immediate detection during inference
- Ensemble detection combining multiple detection methods for improved accuracy
- Confidence-based detection leveraging model uncertainty for adversarial identification
- Gradient-based detection analyzing gradient patterns for adversarial signatures
- Feature-space detection examining intermediate representations for anomalies
- Reconstruction-based detection using autoencoders to identify adversarial perturbations
- Temporal detection analyzing sequences of inputs for adversarial patterns
- Cross-modal detection identifying adversarial examples across different modalities
- Adaptive detection learning from new adversarial patterns and attack methods
- Threshold optimization dynamically adjusting detection thresholds for optimal performance
- False positive mitigation reducing incorrect classification of benign inputs
- Interpretable detection providing explanations for detection decisions
- Lightweight detection optimized for resource-constrained environments
- Distributed detection coordinating detection across multiple nodes
- Multi-level detection operating at different stages of the ML pipeline
- Certified detection providing formal guarantees about detection capabilities
- Robust detection maintaining effectiveness against adaptive adversaries
- Universal detection generalizing across different types of adversarial attacks
- Context-aware detection adapting to specific application domains and use cases
- Proactive detection anticipating and preparing for emerging attack vectors
- Forensic detection analyzing adversarial examples for attack attribution
- Performance monitoring tracking detection system effectiveness over time
- Integration APIs enabling seamless incorporation into existing ML workflows
- Detection benchmarking standardizing evaluation of detection methods
- Adversarial training for detectors improving detection through adversarial examples
- Multi-task detection simultaneously detecting multiple types of adversarial inputs

Physical Foundation:
Based on statistical hypothesis testing, anomaly detection theory, and
pattern recognition principles. Incorporates information theory, signal
processing, and machine learning techniques for reliable identification
of adversarial examples while minimizing false positive rates.

Applications:
Essential for security-critical AI systems, autonomous vehicles, and financial
AI applications. Critical for applications requiring input validation,
security screening, threat detection, and robust operation in adversarial
environments where malicious inputs pose significant risks to system integrity.
