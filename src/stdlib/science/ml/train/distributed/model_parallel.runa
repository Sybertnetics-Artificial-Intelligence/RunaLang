Note:
This module provides comprehensive model parallel training capabilities including 
layer partitioning, pipeline parallelism, micro-batching, tensor parallelism, 
and memory optimization. It implements various model parallelism strategies 
for scaling large models across multiple devices, supports both intra-layer 
and inter-layer parallelism, and provides tools for efficient model 
partitioning, activation management, and cross-device communication.
