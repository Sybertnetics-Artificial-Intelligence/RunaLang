Note:
This module provides comprehensive data parallel training capabilities including 
synchronous SGD, gradient accumulation, batch splitting, device management, 
and distributed data loading. It implements various data parallelism strategies 
for scaling training across multiple devices, supports both single-node and 
multi-node configurations, and provides tools for efficient data distribution, 
load balancing, and synchronized parameter updates across distributed workers.
