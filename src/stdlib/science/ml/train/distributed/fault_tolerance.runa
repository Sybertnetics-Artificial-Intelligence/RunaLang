Note:
This module provides comprehensive fault tolerance capabilities including 
failure detection, recovery protocols, redundancy strategies, checkpointing 
coordination, and resilient training orchestration. It implements various 
fault tolerance mechanisms for distributed training, supports both proactive 
and reactive failure handling, and provides tools for maintaining training 
continuity, state recovery, and system resilience under various failure 
scenarios.
