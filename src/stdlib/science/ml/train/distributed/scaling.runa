Note:
This module provides comprehensive dynamic scaling capabilities including 
dynamic worker allocation, load balancing, autoscaling policies, resource 
elasticity, and performance-driven scaling. It implements various scaling 
strategies for distributed training, supports both horizontal and vertical 
scaling, and provides tools for adaptive resource management, cost optimization, 
and performance-aware scaling decisions based on training dynamics and 
system utilization metrics.
