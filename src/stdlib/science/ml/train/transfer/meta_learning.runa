Physical Foundation:
Based on optimization theory, statistical learning theory, and computational
learning theory. Incorporates gradient-based optimization, Bayesian inference,
and information theory for systematic improvement of learning algorithms
and rapid adaptation to new learning scenarios and task distributions.

Applications:
Essential for automated machine learning, few-shot learning, and adaptive AI
systems. Critical for applications requiring rapid adaptation, personalized
learning, algorithm automation, and efficient learning in data-scarce
environments where traditional learning approaches are insufficient or inefficient.
