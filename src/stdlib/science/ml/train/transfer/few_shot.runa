Few-Shot Learning Methods

This module provides few-shot learning capabilities for machine learning
systems including prototypical networks, matching networks, model-agnostic
meta-learning, relation networks, and gradient-based meta-learning for
building AI systems with efficient few-shot learning that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited training examples, leverage prior knowledge
effectively, and generalize across diverse task distributions through
systematic meta-learning approaches and intelligent few-shot adaptation strategies.

Key Features:
- Prototypical networks learning prototype representations for few-shot classification
- Matching networks implementing attention-based matching for few-shot learning
- Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) enabling fast adaptation across diverse tasks
- Relation networks learning generalizable similarity metrics for few-shot tasks
- Gradient-based meta-learning optimizing for rapid task adaptation
- Memory-augmented networks incorporating external memory for few-shot learning
- Siamese networks learning similarity functions for one-shot and few-shot tasks

- Task-agnostic feature extractors learning transferable representations
- Meta-optimization algorithms optimizing meta-learning objectives efficiently
- Few-shot regression extending few-shot learning beyond classification tasks
- Transductive few-shot learning leveraging unlabeled query examples
- Semi-supervised few-shot learning combining labeled and unlabeled target data
- Cross-modal few-shot learning adapting across different data modalities
- Continual few-shot learning maintaining adaptation across sequential tasks
- Hierarchical few-shot learning exploiting task hierarchies for better adaptation
- Bayesian few-shot learning incorporating uncertainty in few-shot predictions
- Metric learning approaches optimizing distance functions for few-shot tasks
- Data augmentation strategies enhancing few-shot learning with synthetic examples
- Transfer learning integration combining pre-training with few-shot adaptation
- Active few-shot learning selecting most informative examples for adaptation
- Multi-task few-shot learning sharing knowledge across related few-shot tasks
- Zero-shot learning predicting on completely unseen classes without examples
- One-shot learning adapting with single examples per class or task
- K-shot learning generalizing to arbitrary numbers of examples per class
- Few-shot optimization specialized optimization techniques for limited data
- Meta-dataset construction creating diverse training distributions for meta-learning
- Evaluation protocols standardized assessment of few-shot learning performance
- Negative transfer mitigation preventing harmful knowledge transfer
- Task similarity analysis understanding relationships between few-shot tasks

Physical Foundation:
Based on meta-learning theory, optimization principles, and statistical
learning theory. Incorporates gradient-based optimization, Bayesian inference,
and similarity learning for effective knowledge transfer and rapid adaptation
with minimal training data across diverse task distributions.

Applications:
Essential for personalized AI, rapid prototyping, and data-scarce domains.
Critical for applications requiring quick adaptation to new users, domains,
or tasks where extensive data collection is impractical, expensive, or
time-sensitive in dynamic environments requiring immediate model deployment.
