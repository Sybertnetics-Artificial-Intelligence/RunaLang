Note:
Continuous Model Updates and Lifecycle Management for Runa

This module implements continuous model update systems for maintaining and
improving machine learning models in production environments. Provides
automated retraining workflows, incremental learning capabilities, and
seamless model deployment strategies for evolving ML systems.

Key Features:
- Automated retraining triggers based on performance degradation
- Incremental learning with online and mini-batch updates
- Continuous learning pipelines with streaming data integration
- Model versioning and backward compatibility management
- A/B testing frameworks for model update validation
- Gradual rollout strategies with automatic rollback capabilities
- Data freshness monitoring and trigger-based updates
- Performance regression detection during model updates
- Multi-stage update validation with quality gates
- Hot-swapping and zero-downtime model replacement
- Update scheduling and maintenance window management
- Feedback loop integration for continuous improvement
- Model ensemble updates and dynamic weighting
- Transfer learning for efficient model adaptation
- Change management and approval workflows for critical updates

Physical Foundation:
Continuous model updates leverage online learning algorithms, streaming
data processing, and software deployment principles. This involves
statistical learning theory, concept drift adaptation, and system
reliability engineering for maintaining model performance over time.

Applications:
- Recommendation systems with evolving user preferences
- Financial fraud detection with adversarial adaptation
- Natural language processing with vocabulary evolution
- Computer vision systems with changing visual patterns
- Autonomous systems requiring continuous safety improvements
- IoT applications with sensor drift and environmental changes
- Healthcare systems with evolving medical knowledge
