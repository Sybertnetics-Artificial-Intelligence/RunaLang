Note:
Model Serving Preparation and Deployment Readiness for Runa

This module implements comprehensive model serving preparation workflows that
transform trained models into production-ready serving formats. Provides
model packaging, validation, configuration management, and deployment
readiness assessment for reliable and scalable model serving.

Key Features:
- Model artifact packaging with versioning and metadata management
- Serving format conversion and compatibility validation
- Model signature validation and API contract definition
- Dependencies management and environment specification
- Model validation with comprehensive test suites
- Performance benchmarking and resource requirement estimation
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Configuration management for serving parameters
- Health check implementation and monitoring setup
- Documentation generation for model APIs and usage
- Rollback preparation and disaster recovery planning
- Multi-environment deployment configuration
- Compliance verification and audit trail preparation
- Containerization and orchestration manifest generation
- Serving readiness assessment and quality gates

Physical Foundation:
Model serving preparation leverages software engineering principles,
containerization technologies, and distributed systems design patterns.
This involves artifact management, configuration as code, testing
frameworks, and deployment automation for reliable service delivery.

Applications:
- Enterprise ML platforms requiring strict deployment processes
- Financial services with regulatory compliance requirements
- Healthcare systems needing model validation and audit trails
- E-commerce platforms with high availability requirements
- Autonomous systems requiring safety validation
- Real-time inference services with performance guarantees
- Multi-tenant platforms with isolation and security needs
