Note:
Production Model Monitoring and Observability for Runa

This module implements comprehensive monitoring and observability solutions
for machine learning models in production environments. Provides real-time
performance tracking, data drift detection, model degradation monitoring,
and automated alerting systems for maintaining reliable ML services.

Key Features:
- Real-time model performance monitoring with custom metrics
- Data drift detection using statistical and machine learning methods
- Model accuracy degradation tracking and alert systems
- Input/output data quality monitoring and validation
- Bias detection and fairness monitoring for responsible AI
- Explainability tracking and feature importance monitoring
- A/B testing frameworks for model comparison and validation
- Business KPI integration and impact measurement
- Distributed tracing for complex ML inference pipelines
- Log analysis and anomaly detection in model behavior
- Resource utilization monitoring and cost optimization
- SLA compliance monitoring and availability tracking
- Automated incident response and escalation procedures
- Dashboard creation and stakeholder reporting tools
- Integration with DevOps and MLOps toolchains

Physical Foundation:
Model monitoring leverages statistical process control, time series analysis,
and distributed systems observability principles. This involves change point
detection algorithms, statistical hypothesis testing, and stream processing
for real-time analysis of model behavior and system performance.

Applications:
- Financial services with regulatory compliance and risk monitoring
- Healthcare systems requiring safety and efficacy tracking
- E-commerce platforms with recommendation system monitoring
- Autonomous systems with critical safety monitoring requirements
- Natural language processing services with bias detection needs
- Manufacturing systems with predictive maintenance monitoring
- Fraud detection systems with adversarial attack monitoring
