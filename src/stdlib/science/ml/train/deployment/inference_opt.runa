Note:
Inference Optimization for Production ML Models in Runa

This module implements inference optimization techniques for improving the
performance, efficiency, and scalability of machine learning models in
production environments. Provides model optimization, hardware acceleration,
and performance tuning strategies for real-time and batch inference.

Key Features:
- Model quantization with int8, int16, and mixed-precision optimization
- Neural network pruning for model size and latency reduction
- Knowledge distillation for creating faster student models
- Dynamic batching and batch size optimization for throughput
- Graph optimization and operator fusion for computational efficiency
- Hardware-specific optimizations for CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators
- Memory optimization and caching strategies for inference pipelines
- Parallel processing and multi-threading for concurrent inference
- Model compilation and JIT optimization for runtime performance
- Input preprocessing optimization and data pipeline acceleration
- Model serving frameworks and runtime engine optimization
- Latency profiling and bottleneck identification tools
- Auto-tuning systems for performance parameter optimization
- A/B testing frameworks for optimization validation
- Inference cost analysis and resource utilization monitoring

Physical Foundation:
Inference optimization leverages computer architecture principles,
numerical analysis, and algorithmic efficiency techniques. This involves
memory hierarchy optimization, vectorization, parallel computing, and
hardware-software co-design for maximizing computational throughput.

Applications:
- Real-time recommendation systems with sub-millisecond latency
- Computer vision applications for autonomous vehicles and robotics
- Natural language processing services with high-throughput requirements
- Mobile and edge computing with resource-constrained environments
- Financial trading systems requiring ultra-low latency inference
- IoT devices with power and memory limitations
- Large-scale batch processing for offline analytics
