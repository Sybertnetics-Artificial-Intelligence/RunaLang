Note:
This module provides comprehensive dropout regularization techniques including 
standard dropout, spatial dropout, variational dropout, dropconnect, structured 
dropout patterns, and adaptive dropout mechanisms. It implements various dropout 
variants for different neural network architectures, supports both training and 
inference modes, and provides tools for preventing overfitting while maintaining 
model capacity through stochastic regularization methods that randomly disable 
network components during training.
