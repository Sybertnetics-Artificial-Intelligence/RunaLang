Note:
This module provides comprehensive weight decay and norm-based regularization 
techniques including L1/L2 regularization, elastic net, group lasso, nuclear 
norm, spectral norm, and adaptive weight decay mechanisms. It implements various 
regularization penalties for preventing overfitting, supports different parameter 
groups, and provides tools for controlling model complexity through weight 
magnitude constraints and sparsity-inducing regularizers that encourage 
structured solutions in neural network training.
