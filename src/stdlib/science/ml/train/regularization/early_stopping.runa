Note:
This module provides comprehensive early stopping techniques including 
patience-based stopping, validation metric monitoring, model selection 
criteria, adaptive stopping thresholds, and multi-metric early stopping. 
It implements various stopping strategies for preventing overfitting, 
supports both simple and complex stopping conditions, and provides tools 
for optimal training duration determination through automatic monitoring 
of generalization performance and convergence detection.
