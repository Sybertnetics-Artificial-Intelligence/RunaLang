Note:
This module provides comprehensive batch normalization techniques including 
standard batch normalization, running statistics management, training/inference 
mode handling, virtual batch normalization, and momentum-based updates. It 
implements various batch normalization variants for different neural network 
architectures, supports both 2D and higher-dimensional tensors, and provides 
tools for stabilizing training dynamics through activation normalization and 
variance reduction techniques.
