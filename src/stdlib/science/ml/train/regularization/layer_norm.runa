Note:
This module provides comprehensive layer normalization techniques including 
standard layer normalization, group normalization, instance normalization, 
switchable normalization, and root mean square layer normalization. It 
implements various layer-wise normalization variants for different neural 
network architectures, supports both pre and post-normalization configurations, 
and provides tools for stabilizing training dynamics through per-sample 
activation normalization independent of batch statistics.
