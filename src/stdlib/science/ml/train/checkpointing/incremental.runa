Note:
This module provides comprehensive incremental checkpointing capabilities 
including delta updates, versioning systems, branching checkpoints, efficient 
storage management, and change tracking. It implements various incremental 
checkpointing strategies for efficient storage utilization, supports both 
forward and backward delta compression, and provides tools for checkpoint 
genealogy management, selective restoration, and optimized update propagation.
