Note:
This module provides comprehensive training recovery capabilities including 
automatic failure detection, state restoration from checkpoints, partial 
recovery mechanisms, recovery validation, and training resumption protocols. 
It implements various recovery strategies for distributed training, supports 
both complete and partial state recovery, and provides tools for recovery 
optimization, failure analysis, training continuity assurance, and robust 
recovery coordination across distributed systems.
