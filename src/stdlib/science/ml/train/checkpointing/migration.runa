Note:
This module provides comprehensive checkpoint migration capabilities including 
format conversion, version upgrade/downgrade, cross-framework migration, 
platform adaptation, and backward compatibility. It implements various 
migration strategies for checkpoint portability, supports both automatic 
and manual migration processes, and provides tools for migration validation, 
rollback mechanisms, batch processing, and seamless integration with 
different training environments and frameworks.
