Note:
This module provides comprehensive checkpoint validation capabilities including 
integrity checks, corruption detection, state consistency verification, and 
validation protocols. It implements various validation strategies for ensuring 
checkpoint reliability, supports both structural and semantic validation, and 
provides tools for automated validation workflows, error detection, recovery 
recommendations, and checkpoint quality assessment.
