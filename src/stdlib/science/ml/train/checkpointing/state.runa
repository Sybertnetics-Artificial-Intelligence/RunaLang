Note:
This module provides comprehensive training state management including 
complete model state saving, optimizer state persistence, random number 
generator state tracking, training metadata storage, and distributed state 
coordination. It implements various state management strategies for training 
resumption, supports both local and distributed checkpointing scenarios, 
and provides tools for state validation, compression, and efficient 
serialization of all training components.
