Main Training Loop and Epoch Management Module for Scientific Computing

This module provides comprehensive training loop orchestration and epoch management
capabilities for machine learning model training. Covers the main training loop,
batch iteration, epoch progression, and training orchestration. Essential for
coordinating the entire training process with proper state management, metrics
tracking, and event handling for professional ML training systems.

Key Features:
- Complete training loop orchestration with epoch and batch management
- Event-driven architecture with customizable hooks and callbacks
- Automatic mixed precision training support and gradient scaling
- Early stopping mechanisms and model selection criteria
- Distributed training coordination and synchronization
- Training resumption from checkpoints with state recovery
- Real-time metrics computation and logging integration
- Memory-efficient training with gradient accumulation strategies

Implements state-of-the-art training orchestration patterns including PyTorch
Lightning-compatible interfaces, TensorFlow Keras-style callbacks, and comprehensive
training loop abstractions for professional machine learning applications.
