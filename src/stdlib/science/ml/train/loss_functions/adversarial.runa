Note:
This module provides comprehensive adversarial loss functions including 
GAN losses (Wasserstein, least squares), discriminator and generator 
objectives, adversarial training losses, and domain adaptation losses. 
It implements various adversarial learning approaches for generative 
modeling, supports both minimax and non-saturating formulations, and 
provides tools for stable adversarial training through specialized 
objective functions and regularization techniques.
