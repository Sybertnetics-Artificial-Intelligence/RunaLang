Note:
This module provides comprehensive contrastive learning loss functions including 
triplet loss, InfoNCE, SimCLR losses, metric learning objectives, and 
self-supervised contrastive losses. It implements various contrastive learning 
approaches for representation learning, supports both supervised and 
unsupervised contrastive methods, and provides tools for learning discriminative 
embeddings through positive and negative sample contrast in high-dimensional 
feature spaces.
