Note:
This module provides comprehensive custom loss function framework including 
composite loss combinations, adaptive loss weighting, dynamic loss scheduling, 
and domain-specific loss construction. It implements flexible tools for 
creating custom loss functions, supports both simple and complex loss 
combinations, and provides utilities for loss function optimization, 
automatic differentiation, and performance monitoring.
