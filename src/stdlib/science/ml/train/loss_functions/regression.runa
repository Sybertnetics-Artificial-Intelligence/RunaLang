Note:
This module provides comprehensive regression loss functions including 
mean squared error, mean absolute error, Huber loss, quantile loss, 
log-cosh loss, asymmetric losses, and robust regression losses. It 
implements various loss functions for different regression scenarios, 
supports both single and multi-output regression, and provides tools 
for handling outliers, heteroscedastic noise, and complex regression 
objectives through specialized loss formulations.
