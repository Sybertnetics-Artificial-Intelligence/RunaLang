Note:
This module provides comprehensive multi-task learning loss functions including 
task balancing, uncertainty weighting, gradient normalization, task clustering, 
and hierarchical multi-task objectives. It implements various approaches for 
learning multiple related tasks simultaneously, supports both hard and soft 
parameter sharing, and provides tools for automatic task weighting, conflict 
resolution, and performance optimization across diverse task combinations.
