Note:
This module provides comprehensive classification loss functions including 
cross-entropy loss, focal loss, label smoothing, balanced class losses, 
ordinal regression losses, and hierarchical classification losses. It 
implements various loss functions for different classification scenarios, 
supports both binary and multi-class classification, and provides tools 
for handling class imbalance, noisy labels, and complex classification 
hierarchies through specialized objective functions.
