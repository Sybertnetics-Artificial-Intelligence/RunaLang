Note:
This module provides comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities 
for scientific computing and machine learning including Monte Carlo methods, 
polynomial chaos expansion, stochastic collocation, Bayesian inference, 
sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty propagation techniques. It enables 
robust decision-making under uncertainty, reliability analysis, and risk 
assessment for complex scientific and engineering systems with proper 
treatment of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties.
