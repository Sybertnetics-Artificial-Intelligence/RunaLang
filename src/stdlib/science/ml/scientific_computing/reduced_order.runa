Note:
This module provides comprehensive reduced order modeling (ROM) capabilities 
including proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), 
balanced truncation, Galerkin projection methods, and machine learning-enhanced 
ROM techniques. It enables efficient model reduction for high-dimensional 
systems, real-time simulation, parameter exploration, and control applications 
while preserving essential system dynamics and maintaining computational accuracy.
