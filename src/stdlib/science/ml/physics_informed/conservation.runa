Note:
This module provides comprehensive conservation law enforcement capabilities 
for physics-informed machine learning including energy conservation, momentum 
conservation, mass conservation, charge conservation, and custom conservation 
principles. It implements various enforcement strategies, constraint satisfaction 
methods, Lagrangian mechanics integration, Hamiltonian preservation, and 
automatic verification of conservation properties in neural network training 
and inference for physically consistent machine learning models.
