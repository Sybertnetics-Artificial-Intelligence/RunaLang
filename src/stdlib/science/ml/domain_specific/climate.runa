Note:
This module provides comprehensive machine learning capabilities for climate 
science including climate model emulation, downscaling, extreme event prediction, 
attribution studies, paleoclimate reconstruction, and carbon cycle modeling. 
It implements various ML architectures for climate data, handles spatiotemporal 
climate patterns, supports ensemble modeling, and provides tools for climate 
impact assessment, adaptation planning, and mitigation strategy optimization 
through data-driven approaches and physics-aware machine learning methods.
