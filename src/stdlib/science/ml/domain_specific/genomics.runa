Note:
This module provides comprehensive machine learning capabilities for genomics 
and computational biology including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), 
variant calling, phylogenetic analysis, protein structure prediction, gene 
expression analysis, and personalized medicine. It implements various ML 
architectures for genomic data, handles sequence analysis, supports population 
genetics, and provides tools for drug target discovery, biomarker identification, 
and precision medicine through data-driven approaches and biologically-informed 
machine learning methods.
