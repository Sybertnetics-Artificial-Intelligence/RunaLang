This module provides comprehensive active learning capabilities for experimental 
design and scientific discovery including query strategies, acquisition functions, 
uncertainty-based sampling, optimal experimental design, and adaptive data 
collection. It implements various active learning algorithms for efficient 
exploration of experimental spaces, model improvement, and scientific hypothesis 
testing with minimal experimental cost while maximizing information gain 
and discovery potential.
