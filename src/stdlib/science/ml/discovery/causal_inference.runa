Note:
This module provides comprehensive causal inference capabilities including 
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), causal discovery algorithms, intervention 
analysis, counterfactual reasoning, and structural causal models. It implements 
various causal discovery methods, confounding adjustment techniques, mediation 
analysis, and causal effect estimation from observational and experimental 
data for understanding cause-and-effect relationships in complex scientific 
and engineering systems.
