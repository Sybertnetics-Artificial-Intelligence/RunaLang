Note:
This module provides comprehensive equation discovery capabilities including 
sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), automated equation 
discovery from data, dynamical systems identification, and governing equation 
extraction. It implements various sparsity-promoting algorithms, library-based 
approaches, and data-driven methods for discovering interpretable mathematical 
models, differential equations, and physical laws directly from observational 
and experimental data with minimal prior assumptions.
