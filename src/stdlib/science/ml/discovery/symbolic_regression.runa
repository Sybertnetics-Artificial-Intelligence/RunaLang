Note:
This module provides comprehensive symbolic regression capabilities including 
genetic programming, evolutionary algorithms, neural symbolic approaches, 
and mathematical expression discovery from data. It implements various 
representation schemes, fitness evaluation methods, operator selection 
strategies, and parsimony control mechanisms for automatically discovering 
interpretable mathematical relationships, physical laws, and governing 
equations from experimental and computational data.
