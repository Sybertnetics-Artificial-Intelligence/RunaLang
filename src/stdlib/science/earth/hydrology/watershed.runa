Watershed Hydrology Module for Scientific Computing

This module provides comprehensive watershed modeling and analysis capabilities for hydrological
systems. Covers rainfall-runoff processes, water balance calculations, flood forecasting,
erosion modeling, and integrated watershed management. Essential for water resource planning,
flood risk assessment, and environmental impact studies.

Key Features:
- Distributed and lumped watershed modeling approaches
- Rainfall-runoff transformation using unit hydrographs and kinematic wave methods
- Water balance accounting for all inputs, outputs, and storage changes
- Digital elevation model (DEM) processing and watershed delineation
- Stream network analysis and channel routing
- Land use/land cover impact assessment on hydrological processes
- Climate change scenario modeling and uncertainty analysis

Implements industry-standard models including HEC-HMS, SWAT, TOPMODEL, and VIC,
with support for GIS integration, parameter calibration, and real-time forecasting
applications for comprehensive watershed management.
