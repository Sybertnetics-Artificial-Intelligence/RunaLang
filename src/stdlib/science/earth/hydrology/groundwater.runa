Groundwater Hydrology Module for Scientific Computing

This module provides comprehensive modeling and analysis capabilities for groundwater systems.
Covers aquifer characterization, flow dynamics, pumping test analysis, contaminant transport,
recharge/discharge processes, and groundwater-surface water interactions. Essential for
hydrogeological studies, water resource management, and environmental assessments.

Key Features:
- Aquifer property determination and spatial interpolation
- Groundwater flow modeling using finite difference/element methods  
- Pumping test analysis for transmissivity and storage coefficient estimation
- Contaminant transport modeling with advection-dispersion-reaction processes
- Well hydraulics including drawdown prediction and capture zone analysis
- Groundwater dating and residence time calculations
- Interaction modeling between groundwater and surface water bodies

Implements industry-standard methods including Theis, Cooper-Jacob, Neuman solutions,
MODFLOW-compatible grid systems, and advanced numerical solvers for complex hydrogeological
scenarios including fractured rock and multi-layer systems.
