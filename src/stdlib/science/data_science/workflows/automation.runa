This module provides comprehensive workflow automation capabilities including 
intelligent scheduling, event-driven automation, job management, resource 
provisioning, automated decision making, and adaptive workflow execution. 
It supports various triggers (time-based, data-driven, external events), 
implements sophisticated orchestration patterns, and provides integration 
with enterprise systems for seamless scientific workflow automation across 
research environments and computational infrastructures.
