Note:
This module provides comprehensive data processing pipeline capabilities including 
pipeline design, execution engines, task orchestration, dependency management, 
data flow optimization, error handling, monitoring, and scalable processing 
architectures. It supports both batch and streaming data processing, implements 
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for workflow representation, and provides 
integration with distributed computing frameworks for high-performance 
scientific data processing and analysis workflows.
