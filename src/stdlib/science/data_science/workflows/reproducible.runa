Note:
This module provides comprehensive reproducible research capabilities including 
environment management, containerization, version control integration, 
computational notebooks, research object creation, and FAIR data principles 
implementation. It ensures complete reproducibility of scientific workflows 
through standardized practices, automated documentation, dependency tracking, 
and platform-independent execution environments for transparent and verifiable 
scientific computing.
