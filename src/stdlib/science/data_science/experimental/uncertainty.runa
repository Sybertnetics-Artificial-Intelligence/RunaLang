Note:
This module provides comprehensive uncertainty analysis and error propagation 
capabilities for experimental data including measurement uncertainty evaluation, 
Monte Carlo error propagation, Taylor series approximations, bootstrap uncertainty 
estimation, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, and 
confidence interval construction. It implements international standards (GUM, 
ISO/IEC Guide 98) for uncertainty evaluation in scientific measurements and 
experimental results with proper treatment of systematic and random errors.
