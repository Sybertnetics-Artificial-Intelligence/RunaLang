Note:
This module provides comprehensive experimental design capabilities including 
design of experiments (DOE), factorial designs, response surface methodology, 
randomized controlled trials, blocking strategies, Latin squares, orthogonal 
arrays, optimal designs, and experimental planning for scientific research. 
It covers sample size calculations, power analysis, randomization procedures, 
and optimization of experimental layouts for maximum information extraction 
with minimal resources and proper statistical inference.
