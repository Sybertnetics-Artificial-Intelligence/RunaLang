Note:
This module provides comprehensive statistical analysis capabilities for 
experimental data including hypothesis testing, analysis of variance (ANOVA), 
regression analysis, multivariate statistics, Bayesian inference, nonparametric 
methods, and effect size calculations. It covers model selection, assumption 
checking, multiple comparisons, mixed-effects modeling, and advanced statistical 
procedures for extracting meaningful insights from experimental results with 
proper uncertainty quantification and statistical rigor.
