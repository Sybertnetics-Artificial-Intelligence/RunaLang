Note:
This module provides comprehensive scientific data repository management 
capabilities including repository creation, data archiving, version control, 
access control, data discovery, repository federation, digital preservation, 
and compliance with institutional and funding agency requirements. It supports 
various repository types (institutional, disciplinary, general-purpose), 
metadata harvesting, data citation, and integration with research workflows 
for sustainable data management and sharing.
