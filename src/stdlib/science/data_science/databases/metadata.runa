Note:
This module provides comprehensive metadata management capabilities including 
metadata standards implementation (Dublin Core, DataCite, DCAT, CF conventions), 
ontology integration, semantic annotation, metadata validation, automated 
metadata extraction, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) 
data principles enforcement. It supports linked data formats, vocabulary 
management, and standardized scientific metadata workflows for enhanced 
data discoverability and interoperability.
