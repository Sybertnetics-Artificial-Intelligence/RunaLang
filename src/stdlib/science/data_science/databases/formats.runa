Note:
This module provides comprehensive scientific data format support including 
HDF5, NetCDF, Parquet, Arrow, FITS, CDF, and other domain-specific formats. 
It handles format conversion, metadata preservation, compression optimization, 
schema validation, and efficient I/O operations for large scientific datasets. 
The module ensures data integrity, supports parallel I/O, and provides 
unified interfaces for heterogeneous scientific data storage and exchange 
across different research domains and computational platforms.
