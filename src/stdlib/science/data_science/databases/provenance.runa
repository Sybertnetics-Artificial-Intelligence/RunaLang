Note:
This module provides comprehensive data provenance tracking and management 
capabilities including lineage tracking, audit trails, reproducibility 
documentation, workflow execution history, data transformation logs, and 
compliance with provenance standards (PROV, W3C). It enables complete 
traceability of scientific data from collection through analysis, supports 
automated provenance capture, and facilitates reproducible research through 
detailed documentation of data processing pipelines and computational workflows.
