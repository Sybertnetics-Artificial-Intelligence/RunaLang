Orbital Perturbations and N-Body Problem Module for Scientific Computing

This module provides comprehensive orbital perturbation analysis and N-body problem
solutions for celestial mechanics. Covers gravitational perturbations, non-gravitational
forces, secular variations, and complex multi-body dynamics. Essential for precise
orbit determination, long-term stability analysis, and spacecraft trajectory design.

Key Features:
- General and special perturbation theories for orbital motion
- N-body problem solutions using numerical integration methods
- Secular and periodic perturbation analysis using analytical theories
- Non-gravitational force modeling (radiation pressure, atmospheric drag)
- Resonance analysis and chaotic motion detection
- Restricted three-body problem solutions and Lagrange points
- Hill sphere and sphere of influence calculations
- Long-term orbital evolution and stability assessment

Implements advanced perturbation theories including Gauss planetary equations,
Delaunay variables, canonical transformations, and modern numerical methods
for high-precision orbital dynamics analysis and prediction.
