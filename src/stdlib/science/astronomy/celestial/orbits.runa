Celestial Orbital Mechanics Module for Scientific Computing

This module provides comprehensive orbital mechanics calculations and analysis capabilities
for celestial bodies. Covers Kepler's laws, orbital elements, trajectory calculations,
orbit determination, and perturbation analysis. Essential for astronomical observations,
spacecraft mission planning, and celestial navigation.

Key Features:
- Classical orbital elements (semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, etc.)
- Kepler's equation solving and anomaly calculations
- Coordinate system transformations (equatorial, ecliptic, orbital)
- Two-body and restricted three-body problem solutions
- Orbit propagation using analytical and numerical methods
- Lambert's problem for transfer orbit calculations
- Satellite visibility and ground track predictions

Implements industry-standard algorithms including Kepler solvers, Gauss methods,
Universal Variable formulation, and high-precision ephemeris calculations for
comprehensive orbital mechanics analysis and mission design applications.
