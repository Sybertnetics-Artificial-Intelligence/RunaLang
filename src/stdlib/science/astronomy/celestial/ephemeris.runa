Ephemeris Calculations Module for Scientific Computing

This module provides comprehensive ephemeris calculation capabilities for celestial bodies.
Covers position predictions, coordinate transformations, time systems, and high-precision
astronomical calculations. Essential for telescope pointing, navigation, and astronomical
observations requiring accurate celestial object positions.

Key Features:
- High-precision planetary and lunar ephemeris calculations
- Multiple time system conversions (UTC, TAI, TT, TDB, etc.)
- Coordinate system transformations and proper motion corrections
- Asteroid and comet ephemeris generation from orbital elements
- Satellite ephemeris calculations and predictions
- Rise, transit, and set time calculations for celestial objects
- Topocentric and geocentric position calculations

Implements JPL DE series ephemeris models, VSOP theories, and industry-standard
astronomical algorithms for sub-arcsecond accuracy in celestial position
calculations for professional astronomical applications.
