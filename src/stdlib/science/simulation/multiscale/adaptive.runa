Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Multiscale Problems

This module provides comprehensive adaptive mesh refinement frameworks for
multiscale simulations with error estimation, automatic mesh adaptation,
dynamic load balancing, and hierarchical data structures for efficient
resolution of multiple length and time scales in complex systems.

Key Features:
- Structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) with octree/quadtree data structures
- Unstructured mesh adaptation with edge splitting and vertex insertion
- Anisotropic mesh adaptation based on solution gradients and Hessians
- Error estimation using recovery methods and residual-based indicators
- Goal-oriented error estimation for quantities of interest
- Multiscale error indicators considering scale interactions
- Dynamic mesh coarsening and refinement with hanging node constraints
- Load balancing algorithms for parallel adaptive computations
- Time-adaptive algorithms with temporal error control
- Multiphysics adaptive refinement for coupled problems
- Machine learning-enhanced adaptation with predictive error indicators
- Conservative interpolation and projection operators
- Mesh quality optimization during adaptation
- Memory-efficient data structures for large-scale adaptive simulations

Physical Foundation:
Based on a posteriori error estimation theory and adaptive finite element
methods with rigorous mathematical foundation from numerical analysis.
Incorporates multiscale analysis principles to capture solution features
across different scales with optimal computational efficiency.

Applications:
Essential for fluid dynamics with shocks, solid mechanics with localization,
multiphase flows, and electromagnetic problems. Critical for problems with
moving fronts, boundary layers, and localized phenomena where uniform
refinement would be computationally prohibitive.
