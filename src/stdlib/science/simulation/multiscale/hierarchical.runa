Hierarchical Modeling Approaches for Multiscale Systems

This module provides comprehensive hierarchical modeling frameworks for
multiscale systems with multigrid methods, multilevel algorithms, wavelet-based
multiresolution analysis, and renormalization group approaches for efficient
simulation of systems with multiple interacting scales.

Key Features:
- Geometric multigrid methods with coarse grid correction
- Algebraic multigrid (AMG) for complex geometries and equations
- Full Approximation Scheme (FAS) for nonlinear problems
- Multilevel Monte Carlo methods for stochastic simulations
- Wavelet-based multiresolution analysis and adaptive thresholding
- Renormalization group methods for critical phenomena
- Hierarchical basis functions with nested spaces
- Multi-level domain decomposition with coarse space acceleration
- Cascadic multigrid with nested iteration strategies
- Multilevel optimization algorithms for design problems
- Hierarchical model reduction with proper orthogonal decomposition
- Multi-fidelity modeling with uncertainty quantification
- Machine learning-enhanced hierarchical methods
- Parallel implementation strategies for hierarchical algorithms

Physical Foundation:
Based on mathematical principles of hierarchical decomposition, spectral
theory, and asymptotic analysis. Incorporates scale separation principles,
variational formulations, and optimal approximation theory to achieve
computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy across multiple scales.

Applications:
Essential for turbulence modeling, materials with microstructure, biological
systems with cellular hierarchy, and climate modeling. Critical for problems
requiring efficient solution of large linear systems, optimization across
multiple scales, and analysis of complex systems with emergent behavior.
