Multiscale Coupling Frameworks

This module provides comprehensive multiscale coupling frameworks for connecting
simulation methods across different length and time scales with domain
decomposition, scale bridging algorithms, and seamless information transfer
between atomistic, mesoscopic, and continuum descriptions.

Key Features:
- Concurrent multiscale coupling with overlapping domains
- Sequential multiscale methods with information passing
- Heterogeneous multiscale methods (HMM) for scale separation
- Equation-free multiscale computation with coarse-graining
- Adaptive resolution schemes with dynamic scale selection
- Domain decomposition methods for spatial scale coupling
- Temporal scale bridging with multiple time stepping
- Force matching and momentum transfer across scales
- Energy conservation and thermodynamic consistency enforcement
- Boundary condition specification at scale interfaces
- Ghost atom methods for seamless molecular-continuum coupling  
- Handshaking region algorithms for smooth transitions
- Machine learning-enhanced scale coupling with surrogate models
- Parallel implementation strategies for multiscale architectures

Physical Foundation:
Based on scale separation principles and homogenization theory with rigorous
mathematical foundation from asymptotic analysis. Incorporates conservation
laws, thermodynamic consistency, and statistical mechanics principles to
ensure physically meaningful coupling across disparate scales.

Applications:
Essential for materials modeling (crack propagation in crystals), biological
systems (protein-membrane interactions), and engineering applications
(turbulence with chemical reactions). Critical for problems where phenomena
at multiple scales interact and cannot be treated independently.
