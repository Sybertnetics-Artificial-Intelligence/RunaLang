Spectral Simulation Methods

This module provides comprehensive spectral simulation frameworks for solving
partial differential equations with exponential accuracy using Fourier,
Chebyshev, and Legendre basis functions. Features advanced spectral element
methods, pseudospectral techniques, and fast transform algorithms for
high-fidelity computational physics and engineering applications.

Key Features:
- Fourier spectral methods for periodic domains with FFT acceleration
- Chebyshev spectral methods for non-periodic domains with clustering
- Legendre spectral methods with optimal conditioning properties
- Spectral element methods combining flexibility with exponential accuracy
- Pseudospectral methods with collocation at optimal quadrature points
- Spectral deferred correction for high-order time integration
- Multi-domain spectral methods for complex geometries
- Mortar spectral element methods for non-conforming interfaces
- Discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods
- Fast multipole-accelerated spectral methods
- Parallel spectral transforms with domain decomposition
- Adaptive spectral methods with wavelets and modal truncation
- Spectral filtering and stabilization techniques
- High-performance implementation with vectorization and GPU support

Physical Foundation:
Based on global polynomial approximations with exponential convergence for
smooth solutions. Incorporates orthogonal polynomial theory, quadrature rules,
and transform methods to achieve spectral accuracy with optimal computational
efficiency for problems with high regularity requirements.

Applications:
Essential for direct numerical simulation of turbulence, atmospheric dynamics,
quantum mechanics, plasma physics, and wave propagation. Critical for
high-fidelity simulations requiring exceptional accuracy in fluid dynamics,
electromagnetics, and acoustics with minimal numerical dispersion.
