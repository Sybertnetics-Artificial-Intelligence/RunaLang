Finite Volume Simulation Methods

This module provides comprehensive finite volume simulation frameworks for
conservation laws and fluid dynamics with advanced flux reconstruction,
Riemann solvers, unstructured mesh support, and high-resolution shock-capturing
schemes for compressible and incompressible flow simulations.

Key Features:
- High-resolution finite volume schemes (MUSCL, PPM, WENO reconstruction)
- Advanced Riemann solvers (exact, HLL, HLLC, Roe, Osher, AUSM)
- Unstructured mesh support with arbitrary polyhedral cells
- Adaptive mesh refinement with solution-adaptive criteria
- Flux-corrected transport for monotonicity preservation  
- Discontinuous Galerkin finite volume hybrid methods
- Immersed boundary and cut-cell methods for complex geometries
- Multiphase flow modeling with interface tracking
- Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)
- Compressible and incompressible flow solvers
- Non-hydrostatic atmospheric and oceanic modeling
- Moving mesh and Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) capabilities
- High-performance parallel computing with load balancing
- Conservative property preservation and entropy stability

Physical Foundation:
Based on integral form of conservation laws with exact conservation properties.
Incorporates Godunov's theorem and upwind principles for hyperbolic systems
with rigorous treatment of discontinuities and shock waves through
characteristic-based flux evaluation and entropy-consistent formulations.

Applications:
Essential for aerospace propulsion, atmospheric modeling, oceanography,
automotive aerodynamics, and industrial fluid processing. Critical for
weather prediction, climate modeling, turbomachinery design, and
multiphase flow applications in chemical and nuclear engineering.
