Advanced Finite Element Simulation Frameworks

This module provides comprehensive finite element simulation frameworks for
complex continuum mechanics problems including advanced element formulations,
adaptive refinement, multiphysics coupling, and high-performance parallel
solvers for large-scale engineering and scientific applications.

Key Features:
- High-order finite elements (hierarchical, spectral, hp-adaptive)
- Isogeometric analysis (NURBS, T-splines) for CAD integration
- Discontinuous Galerkin methods for hyperbolic problems
- Mixed and hybrid finite element formulations
- Mortar methods for non-conforming mesh interfaces
- Extended finite element method (XFEM) for crack propagation
- Partition of unity methods and meshfree coupling
- Adaptive mesh refinement with error estimation
- Multigrid and domain decomposition solvers
- Multiphysics coupling frameworks (fluid-structure, thermo-mechanical)
- Contact mechanics with friction and large deformation
- Phase field methods for fracture and microstructure evolution
- Topology optimization integration with sensitivity analysis
- Parallel computing with MPI and GPU acceleration support

Physical Foundation:
Based on variational principles and weak formulations of partial differential
equations. Incorporates Galerkin and Petrov-Galerkin methods with sophisticated
numerical integration schemes and stabilization techniques for robust solution
of complex multiphysics problems in engineering and science.

Applications:
Essential for aerospace structures, automotive crashworthiness, biomedical
implants, geomechanics, and advanced materials design. Critical for solving
coupled problems in manufacturing processes, environmental engineering,
and next-generation energy systems with experimental validation.
