Finite Difference Simulation Methods

This module provides comprehensive finite difference simulation frameworks for
solving partial differential equations with high-order accuracy, adaptive mesh
refinement, immersed boundary methods, and specialized schemes for hyperbolic,
parabolic, and elliptic problems in complex geometries and multiphysics systems.

Key Features:
- High-order finite difference schemes (up to 10th order accuracy)
- Compact finite difference methods for enhanced accuracy
- Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes for hyperbolic problems
- Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) and flux limiters for shock capturing
- Immersed boundary methods for complex geometries
- Adaptive mesh refinement with block-structured grids
- Multigrid methods for elliptic and parabolic equations
- Spectral deferred correction methods for high-order time integration
- Characteristic-based methods for hyperbolic conservation laws
- Level set and volume of fluid methods for interface tracking
- Ghost cell methods for embedded boundaries
- High-performance parallel implementation with MPI and OpenMP
- Automatic differentiation for sensitivity analysis
- Multi-block and overset grid capabilities

Physical Foundation:
Based on Taylor series expansions and numerical approximations of derivatives
with rigorous stability and accuracy analysis. Incorporates modern numerical
analysis techniques including dispersion-dissipation optimization and
entropy-stable formulations for robust solution of complex flow phenomena.

Applications:
Essential for computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric modeling, plasma
physics, seismic wave propagation, and electromagnetic simulations.
Critical for aerospace applications, weather prediction, and large-scale
environmental simulations requiring high accuracy and computational efficiency.
