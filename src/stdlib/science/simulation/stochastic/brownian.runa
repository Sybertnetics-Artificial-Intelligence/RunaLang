Brownian Dynamics Simulation Methods

This module provides comprehensive Brownian dynamics simulation frameworks for
colloidal systems, biological macromolecules, and soft matter with hydrodynamic
interactions, complex geometries, and advanced boundary conditions for studying
diffusion-limited processes and crowded environments.

Key Features:
- Standard Brownian dynamics with Einstein's diffusion-friction relation
- Hydrodynamic interactions via Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor
- Stokesian dynamics for dense colloidal suspensions  
- Brownian dynamics with electrostatic interactions (DLVO theory)
- Multi-particle collision dynamics (MPC) for explicit solvent
- Confined Brownian motion in complex geometries
- Brownian dynamics with time-dependent external fields
- Reactive Brownian dynamics for diffusion-limited reactions
- Discontinuous molecular dynamics integration with Brownian motion
- Brownian dynamics in viscoelastic media and polymer networks
- Fluctuating hydrodynamics coupling with Brownian particles
- Advanced boundary condition treatments (reflecting, absorbing, periodic)
- Parallel Brownian dynamics with spatial decomposition
- Machine learning enhanced Brownian dynamics for coarse-graining

Physical Foundation:
Based on the overdamped limit of Langevin dynamics where inertial effects
are negligible. Incorporates Einstein-Smoluchowski equation, fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, and hydrodynamic theory for accurate modeling of diffusive transport
phenomena in viscous media with thermal fluctuations.

Applications:
Essential for colloidal science, protein diffusion in cellular environments,
drug delivery systems, and microfluidics. Critical for understanding
biomolecular crowding effects, nanoparticle transport, and designing
lab-on-chip devices with accurate prediction of mixing and reaction kinetics.
