Jump Processes and Rare Event Simulation

This module provides comprehensive frameworks for simulating jump processes,
rare event sampling, and transition path analysis with advanced methods for
studying infrequent but important events in complex systems including kinetic
Monte Carlo, transition path sampling, and accelerated dynamics techniques.

Key Features:
- Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation with variable time steps
- Continuous-time Markov chains with general state spaces
- Rejection-free kinetic Monte Carlo for large rate disparities
- N-fold way algorithm for efficient event selection
- Transition path sampling for rare event characterization
- Forward flux sampling for computing transition rates
- Weighted ensemble methods for enhanced rare event sampling
- Metadynamics and umbrella sampling for free energy landscapes
- Milestoning methods for long timescale processes
- String methods for minimum energy pathways
- Nudged elastic band calculations for transition states
- Parallel replica dynamics for accelerated evolution
- Hyperdynamics methods with bias potentials
- Machine learning-accelerated rare event detection

Physical Foundation:
Based on master equation formalism and Markov jump process theory with
rigorous statistical mechanics foundation. Incorporates transition state theory,
Kramers theory for barrier crossing, and advanced statistical methods for
computing rate constants and pathways in high-dimensional systems.

Applications:
Essential for materials science (crystal growth, defect migration), chemical
kinetics (catalysis, enzyme reactions), biological systems (protein folding,
membrane transport), and climate modeling (extreme weather events) where
rare but crucial processes dominate long-term behavior.
