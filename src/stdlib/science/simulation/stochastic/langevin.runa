Langevin Dynamics Simulation Methods

This module provides comprehensive Langevin dynamics simulation frameworks for
stochastic differential equations with thermal fluctuations, colored noise,
memory effects, and advanced integration schemes for studying Brownian motion,
protein dynamics, and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics systems.

Key Features:
- Standard Langevin dynamics with white noise thermal fluctuations
- Overdamped Langevin dynamics for high-friction systems
- Underdamped Langevin dynamics with inertial effects
- Colored noise Langevin dynamics with correlated fluctuations
- Generalized Langevin equation with memory kernels
- Stochastic differential equation integrators (Euler-Maruyama, Milstein)
- Non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics for driven systems  
- Langevin dynamics in external potentials and force fields
- Multiple timescale Langevin dynamics for multiscale systems
- Position-dependent diffusion coefficient treatments
- Constrained Langevin dynamics with holonomic constraints
- Adaptive timestep algorithms with noise control
- Parallel Langevin dynamics for ensemble simulations
- Advanced sampling methods integration (replica exchange, metadynamics)

Physical Foundation:
Based on fluctuation-dissipation theorem and Einstein's theory of Brownian
motion. Incorporates stochastic calculus and Itô/Stratonovich interpretations
for proper treatment of multiplicative noise with rigorous mathematical
foundation from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and kinetic theory.

Applications:
Essential for molecular dynamics with implicit solvent, protein folding studies,
single-molecule biophysics, and soft matter physics. Critical for modeling
thermal equilibration, non-equilibrium transport phenomena, and stochastic
processes in biological systems where thermal fluctuations are significant.
