Gillespie Algorithm for Stochastic Chemical Reactions

This module provides comprehensive implementations of the Gillespie algorithm
and related stochastic simulation methods for chemical reaction networks with
exact stochastic simulation, tau-leaping, spatial extensions, and advanced
acceleration techniques for large-scale biochemical and systems biology applications.

Key Features:
- Direct Method (Gillespie's original exact algorithm) for chemical reactions
- First Reaction Method with efficient event scheduling
- Next Reaction Method with dependency graphs for sparse systems
- Tau-leaping methods for approximate but efficient simulation
- Adaptive tau-leaping with automatic step size selection
- Spatial Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (spatial SSA) for diffusion-reaction
- Gibson-Bruck method for systems with many species and reactions
- Sorting Direct Method with optimized reaction selection
- Hybrid deterministic-stochastic methods for multi-scale systems
- Stochastic Simulation Algorithm with delays for gene regulatory networks
- Chemical Langevin equation for continuous approximations
- Jump-diffusion processes for spatial stochastic systems
- Parallel implementations for large reaction networks
- Sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation integration

Physical Foundation:
Based on the chemical master equation and Markov jump processes describing
the probabilistic evolution of molecular populations. Incorporates exact
stochastic kinetics theory with rigorous treatment of molecular noise and
fluctuations in small-volume systems where deterministic approximations fail.

Applications:
Essential for systems biology, synthetic biology, biochemical engineering,
and pharmaceutical research. Critical for modeling gene expression, protein
networks, viral dynamics, enzyme kinetics, and cellular signaling pathways
where stochastic effects dominate system behavior.
