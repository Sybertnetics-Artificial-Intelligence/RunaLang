Molecular Monte Carlo Simulation Methods

This module provides specialized Monte Carlo simulation methods for molecular
systems including advanced ensemble sampling, configurational bias techniques,
and molecule-specific sampling algorithms for complex chemical and biological
systems with sophisticated move sets and acceptance criteria.

Key Features:
- Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) for adsorption and phase equilibria
- Isothermal-isobaric (NPT) Monte Carlo with volume and shape fluctuations
- Configurational bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) for chain molecules
- Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo for phase coexistence studies
- Hybrid Monte Carlo combining MD and MC moves
- Smart Monte Carlo moves (reptation, pivot, concerted rotation)
- Molecular insertion/deletion with chemical potential control
- Wang-Landau sampling for density of states calculations
- Parallel tempering Monte Carlo for enhanced sampling
- Umbrella sampling Monte Carlo along reaction coordinates
- Molecular geometry optimization using Monte Carlo methods
- Advanced acceptance criteria (Metropolis, heat bath, Glauber)
- Multi-canonical ensemble sampling for rare event studies
- Interface Monte Carlo for surface and membrane studies

Physical Foundation:
Based on statistical mechanics principles with detailed balance and ergodicity
ensuring proper ensemble sampling. Incorporates advanced sampling theory for
enhanced exploration of configuration space and accurate calculation of
thermodynamic properties from molecular-level interactions.

Applications:
Critical for studying phase transitions, adsorption isotherms, protein folding,
drug-receptor binding, polymer conformations, and liquid-liquid equilibria.
Essential for materials design, catalyst optimization, and understanding
complex molecular recognition processes in biological systems.
