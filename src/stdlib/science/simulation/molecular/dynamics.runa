Molecular Dynamics Simulation Frameworks

This module provides comprehensive molecular dynamics simulation engines and
advanced force field implementations for atomistic and coarse-grained systems.
Implements state-of-the-art MD algorithms, enhanced sampling methods, and
sophisticated trajectory analysis tools for complex molecular systems.

Key Features:
- Advanced force field implementations (AMBER, CHARMM, OPLS-AA, GROMOS, ReaxFF)
- Multiple integration algorithms (Verlet, velocity-Verlet, leapfrog, RESPA)
- Enhanced sampling methods (replica exchange, metadynamics, umbrella sampling)
- Thermostat and barostat implementations (Nosé-Hoover, Parrinello-Rahman, Langevin)
- Constraint algorithms (SHAKE, RATTLE, SETTLE, P-LINCS)
- Long-range electrostatics (Ewald, PME, reaction field methods)
- Advanced water models (TIP3P, TIP4P, SPC/E, OPC, TIP5P)
- Free energy calculation methods (thermodynamic integration, BAR, MBAR)
- Non-equilibrium MD (NEMD) for transport properties
- Reactive force fields and bond formation/breaking
- GPU acceleration interfaces and parallel decomposition
- Advanced trajectory analysis and property calculation tools
- Path integral molecular dynamics for quantum effects
- Coarse-grained MD with systematic force development

Physical Foundation:
Based on classical mechanics with Newton's equations of motion for many-body
systems. Incorporates statistical mechanics principles for ensemble sampling
and enhanced sampling techniques. Extends to quantum mechanical effects through
path integral methods and incorporates continuum mechanics for hybrid approaches.

Applications:
Essential for drug discovery, materials design, protein folding studies, 
membrane biophysics, catalysis research, and soft matter characterization.
Supports biomolecular simulations, materials science applications, and 
industrial process modeling with experimental validation capabilities.
