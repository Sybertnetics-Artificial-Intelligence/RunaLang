Quantum Mechanical Molecular Simulations

This module provides comprehensive quantum mechanical simulation methods for
molecular systems including ab initio molecular dynamics, density functional
theory calculations, wavefunction-based methods, and hybrid QM/MM approaches
for studying electronic structure and quantum effects in chemical systems.

Key Features:
- Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) with on-the-fly force calculations
- Density functional theory (DFT) implementations with multiple functionals
- Hartree-Fock and post-Hartree-Fock methods (MP2, CCSD, CI)
- Hybrid QM/MM simulations for large biomolecular systems
- Path integral molecular dynamics for nuclear quantum effects
- Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics with electronic structure evolution
- Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics with electronic minimization
- Quantum Monte Carlo methods for electronic structure
- Time-dependent DFT for excited state dynamics
- Semiclassical methods for non-adiabatic dynamics
- Electronic structure optimization and transition state searching
- Solvation models (PCM, COSMO, QM/MM explicit solvation)
- Basis set extrapolation and electronic correlation methods
- Vibrational frequency calculations and normal mode analysis

Physical Foundation:
Based on the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and Born-Oppenheimer
approximation for nuclear-electronic separation. Incorporates density
functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, and quantum mechanical
principles for accurate treatment of electronic structure and chemical bonding.

Applications:
Essential for studying chemical reactions, catalysis mechanisms, electronic
excitation processes, and quantum effects in biological systems. Critical
for drug design, materials discovery, and understanding photochemistry,
electrochemistry, and enzyme catalysis at the molecular level.
