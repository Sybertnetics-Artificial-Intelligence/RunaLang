Coarse-Grained Molecular Modeling

This module provides comprehensive coarse-grained molecular modeling frameworks
for studying large-scale molecular systems with reduced computational cost while
maintaining essential physics. Implements systematic coarse-graining methods,
specialized force fields, and backmapping techniques for multiscale modeling.

Key Features:
- Martini force field implementation for lipids, proteins, and polymers
- United-atom models for alkanes, alcohols, and biomolecules
- Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) for soft matter systems
- Systematic coarse-graining using iterative Boltzmann inversion
- Force matching methods for parameter optimization
- Relative entropy minimization for CG model development
- Elastic network models for protein dynamics
- Go-model implementations for protein folding studies
- Mesoscale membrane modeling with lipid-protein interactions
- Polymer melt and solution modeling with entanglement effects
- Backmapping from CG to all-atom resolution
- Enhanced sampling integration with replica exchange methods
- Self-assembly simulation protocols for complex systems
- Multiscale integration with atomistic and continuum models

Physical Foundation:
Based on statistical mechanics principles with systematic elimination of
fast degrees of freedom while preserving slow collective motions. Incorporates
effective potentials derived from atomistic simulations and analytical theory
to maintain thermodynamic consistency across different resolution levels.

Applications:
Essential for studying membrane proteins, viral assembly, polymer materials,
drug delivery systems, and large biomolecular complexes. Critical for
understanding cellular processes, materials self-assembly, and designing
functional soft matter systems with experimental validation.
