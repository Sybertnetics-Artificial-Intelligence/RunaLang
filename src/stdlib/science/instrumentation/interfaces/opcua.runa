OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) Interface Module for Scientific Computing

This module provides comprehensive OPC UA implementation for modern industrial
communication and data exchange. Covers client-server architecture, publish-
subscribe messaging, information modeling, and security features. Essential
for Industry 4.0 applications, IoT integration, and interoperable communication
between heterogeneous systems in laboratory and manufacturing environments.

Key Features:
- Complete OPC UA client and server implementation with service-oriented architecture
- Information modeling with address space management and type definitions
- Security features including authentication, authorization, and message encryption
- Publish-subscribe communication for real-time data distribution
- Historical data access and event notification systems
- Method calls and complex data type handling
- Discovery services for automatic endpoint detection
- Comprehensive error handling and session management

Implements full OPC UA specification compliance with support for all
service sets, security policies, and transport protocols for professional
industrial automation and scientific instrumentation applications.
