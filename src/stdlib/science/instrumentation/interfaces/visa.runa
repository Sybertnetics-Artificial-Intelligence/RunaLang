- Support for multiple communication interfaces including USB, Ethernet, Serial, GPIB
- SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) command processing
- Instrument identification and capability detection systems
- Error handling and timeout management for reliable communication
- Multi-instrument coordination and resource sharing capabilities
- Automatic instrument configuration and setup procedures
- Comprehensive logging and diagnostic capabilities for troubleshooting
