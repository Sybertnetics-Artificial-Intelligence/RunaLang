Custom Protocol Implementation and Integration Module for Scientific Computing

This module provides comprehensive support for custom communication protocols
and proprietary instrument interfaces in scientific applications. Covers
protocol design, implementation frameworks, legacy system integration, and
vendor-specific communication. Essential for interfacing with specialized
instruments, custom hardware, and proprietary systems that don't use
standard communication protocols.

Key Features:
- Complete custom protocol design and implementation framework
- Binary and text-based protocol parsing and generation capabilities
- Legacy system integration with protocol conversion and bridging
- Vendor-specific protocol support with extensible architecture
- Real-time protocol analysis and debugging tools
- Multi-protocol gateway functionality for heterogeneous environments
- Protocol validation and compliance testing frameworks
- Comprehensive documentation and code generation for custom protocols

Implements flexible protocol abstraction layers with comprehensive
error handling, performance optimization, and extensive customization
capabilities for professional scientific instrumentation applications.
