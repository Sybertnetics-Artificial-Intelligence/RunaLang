High-Level Secure Memory Operations

This module provides safe, high-level abstractions for security-critical memory
operations, built on top of the machine module's low-level primitives.

Key features and capabilities:
- Secure buffer management with automatic zeroing
- Protected memory regions for sensitive data
- Constant-time operations for cryptographic code
- Memory locking to prevent swapping
- Secure random number generation
- Key material lifecycle management
- Side-channel resistant operations
- Automatic cleanup on scope exit
- Integration with garbage collector for secure cleanup
- Platform-independent security guarantees
