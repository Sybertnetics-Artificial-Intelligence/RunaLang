Low-Level Atomic Operations Interface

This module provides foundational atomic operations using compiler intrinsics
and inline assembly for lock-free concurrent programming.

Key features and capabilities:
- Atomic load and store operations
- Compare-and-swap (CAS) primitives
- Atomic arithmetic operations
- Memory ordering semantics
- Fetch-and-modify operations
- Platform-specific atomic instructions
- Lock-free data structure support
- Memory synchronization primitives
- Wait-free algorithm building blocks
- Integration with memory barriers
