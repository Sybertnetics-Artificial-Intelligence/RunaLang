Low-Level System Call Interface

This module provides the foundational system call interface for Runa, enabling
direct operating system communication without external dependencies.

Key features and capabilities:
- Raw syscall interface for all OS operations
- Platform-agnostic syscall wrapper
- Zero external library dependencies
- Direct kernel interface via inline assembly
- Support for all standard POSIX syscalls
- Platform-specific syscall number mapping
- Error handling for syscall failures
- Security boundary enforcement
- Performance-critical path optimization
- Integration foundation for all I/O operations
