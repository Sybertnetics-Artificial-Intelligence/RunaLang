Low-Level Memory Operations Interface

This module provides foundational memory operations that require compiler intrinsics
or inline assembly for proper implementation, ensuring volatile semantics and security.

Key features and capabilities:
- Volatile memory operations (compiler fence enforcement)
- Secure memory zeroing (non-optimizable)
- Memory barriers and fence operations
- Cache control and coherency operations
- Atomic memory operations bridge
- Platform-specific memory alignment
- Memory prefetching hints
- DMA and memory mapping support
- Security-critical memory operations
- Integration with garbage collector safe points
