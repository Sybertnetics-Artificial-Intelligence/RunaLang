Compilation Unit Management API

This module provides comprehensive management for individual compilation units and their dependencies.

Key features and capabilities:
- Compilation unit lifecycle management and configuration
- Source file organization and dependency tracking
- Build order calculation and dependency resolution
- Incremental compilation support with change detection
- Unit metadata management and caching
- Cross-unit dependency analysis and validation
- Resource allocation and compilation constraints
- Error handling for unit compilation failures
- Memory management for large compilation units
- Thread-safe unit processing coordination
