Compiler Interface API

This module provides the primary interface for programmatic access to the Runa compiler system.

Key features and capabilities:
- Complete compiler lifecycle management and session control
- Compilation unit organization and dependency tracking
- Advanced compilation options and configuration management
- Diagnostic collection and error reporting integration
- Artifact generation and consumption pipeline
- Plugin system integration for compiler extensions
- Performance monitoring and compilation statistics
- Incremental compilation support with caching
- Error handling for compilation failures
- Memory management for large compilation sessions
- Multi-threaded compilation coordination
