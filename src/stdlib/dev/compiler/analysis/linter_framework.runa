Linter Framework API

This module provides extensible framework for implementing static code analysis and linting capabilities.

Key features and capabilities:
- Rule-based code quality analysis and validation
- Configurable rule sets and severity levels
- Auto-fixing capabilities for common violations
- Custom rule development and plugin support
- Violation reporting and aggregation
- Performance monitoring and analysis statistics
- Integration with compiler analysis phases
- Error handling for linting failures
- Memory management for analysis data
- Thread-safe linting coordination
