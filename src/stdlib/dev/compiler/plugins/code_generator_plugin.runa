Code Generator Plugin API

This module provides framework for implementing code generation plugins in the compiler pipeline.

Key features and capabilities:
- Multi-target code generation and output formatting
- Template-based code generation with variable substitution
- Code formatting and style application
- Output processing and post-generation optimization
- Target platform-specific code generation
- Performance monitoring and generation statistics
- Integration with compiler backend phases
- Error handling for code generation failures
- Memory management for generated code
- Thread-safe code generation coordination
