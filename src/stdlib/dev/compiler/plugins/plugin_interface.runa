Compiler Plugin Interface API

This module provides the core plugin system interface for extending Runa compiler functionality.

Key features and capabilities:
- Plugin lifecycle management and registration
- Hook system for compiler pipeline integration
- Configuration management and validation
- Plugin communication and message passing
- Dependency resolution and compatibility checking
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and statistics
- Error handling for plugin system failures
- Memory management for plugin execution
- Thread-safe plugin coordination
