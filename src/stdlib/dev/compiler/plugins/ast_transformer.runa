AST Transformation Plugin API

This module provides framework for implementing Abstract Syntax Tree transformations in the compiler pipeline.

Key features and capabilities:
- AST pattern matching and transformation rules
- Syntax tree manipulation and rewriting
- Code generation and template-based transformation
- Pattern-based node matching and replacement
- Transformation condition validation
- Performance monitoring and statistics
- Integration with compiler optimization phases
- Error handling for transformation failures
- Memory management for tree modifications
- Thread-safe transformation coordination
