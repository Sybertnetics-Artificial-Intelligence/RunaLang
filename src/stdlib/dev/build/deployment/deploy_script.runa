Deployment Script Framework and Orchestration System

This module provides comprehensive deployment script management and execution capabilities for the Runa build system, enabling automated deployment orchestration and management.

Key features and capabilities:
- Multi-language deployment script execution (bash, PowerShell, Python, Runa)
- Deployment plan orchestration with step-by-step execution and dependency management
- Parallel and sequential deployment step execution with configurable concurrency
- Automated rollback capabilities with rollback script execution and state recovery
- Deployment validation and health checking with success criteria evaluation
- Environment-specific deployment configuration and variable management
- Deployment monitoring and progress tracking with real-time status updates
- Script timeout management and failure handling with retry mechanisms
- Deployment scheduling and automated execution planning
- Error handling approach for robust deployment operations
- Memory management considerations for large deployment operations
- Concurrency/threading considerations for parallel deployment execution
