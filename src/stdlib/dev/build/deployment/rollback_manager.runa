Deployment Rollback Management and Recovery System

This module provides comprehensive deployment rollback management capabilities for the Runa build system, enabling safe deployment recovery and state restoration.

Key features and capabilities:
- Comprehensive rollback point creation and management with state snapshots
- Multiple rollback strategies (immediate, gradual, blue-green, canary)
- Service version tracking and dependency-aware rollback orchestration
- Database snapshot and configuration state preservation
- Automated rollback validation and integrity verification
- Rollback progress monitoring and real-time status tracking
- Partial rollback support and rollback failure recovery
- Rollback time estimation and impact analysis
- Integration with deployment pipelines and monitoring systems
- Error handling approach for robust rollback operations
- Memory management considerations for large state snapshots
- Concurrency/threading considerations for parallel rollback operations
