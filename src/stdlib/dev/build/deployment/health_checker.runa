Deployment Health Monitoring and Validation System

This module provides comprehensive deployment health checking and monitoring capabilities for the Runa build system, enabling proactive issue detection and system validation.

Key features and capabilities:
- Multi-protocol health checking (HTTP, TCP, database, command-based, custom)
- Continuous deployment health monitoring with real-time status tracking
- Service-level and system-wide health aggregation and reporting
- Configurable health check intervals, timeouts, and retry policies
- Automated alerting and notification system for health issues
- Health trend analysis and uptime calculation with historical tracking
- Integration with monitoring systems and observability platforms
- Customizable success criteria and failure threshold configuration
- Load balancer and service mesh health check integration
- Error handling approach for robust health monitoring operations
- Memory management considerations for continuous monitoring processes
- Concurrency/threading considerations for parallel health check execution
