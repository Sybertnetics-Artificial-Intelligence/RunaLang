Release Notes Generation and Documentation System

This module provides comprehensive release notes generation and documentation capabilities for the Runa build system, enabling automated changelog creation and release communication.

Key features and capabilities:
- Automated release notes generation from version control systems and commit history
- Multi-format output support (Markdown, HTML, JSON, plain text, PDF)
- Intelligent change categorization and impact analysis with semantic versioning
- Git integration with commit parsing and change extraction from repository history
- Template-based release documentation with customizable formatting and branding
- Breaking change detection and upgrade instruction generation
- Release comparison and diff analysis for version-to-version changes
- Integration with issue tracking systems and project management tools
- Automated release announcement generation for different audiences
- Error handling approach for robust documentation generation
- Memory management considerations for large repository history processing
- Concurrency/threading considerations for parallel change analysis operations
