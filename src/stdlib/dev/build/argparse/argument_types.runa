Argument Type System and Type Conversion Framework

This module provides comprehensive type definition, conversion, and validation
capabilities for command-line argument parsing. It supports built-in types,
custom type definitions, and extensible conversion frameworks.

- File system type validation (file paths, directory paths, executable files)
- Complex type definitions with validation rules and constraints
- Custom type registration and extension framework
- Type conversion with comprehensive error handling and reporting
- Advanced validation chains with multiple constraint checking
- Locale-aware type conversion for international applications
- Performance-optimized type conversion for large argument sets
- Integration with validation frameworks and custom validators
- Type inference and automatic type detection from values
- Type coercion and compatibility checking between types
- Range validation for numeric types with boundary checking
- Pattern matching and regex validation for string types
- Collection type support for lists and arrays of arguments
- Custom formatter integration for specialized type display
- Type serialization and deserialization for configuration files
- Memory-efficient type handling for resource-constrained environments
- Integration with debugging and error reporting systems
- Extensible plugin architecture for third-party type definitions
- Thread-safe type conversion for concurrent argument processing
