Note: Parse version string to semantic version
Process called "parse_version" that takes version_string as String returns SemanticVersion:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Version parsing not implemented"

Note: Compare two semantic versions
Process called "compare_versions" that takes version1 as SemanticVersion and version2 as SemanticVersion returns Integer:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Version comparison not implemented"

Note: Check if version satisfies constraint
Process called "satisfies_constraint" that takes version as SemanticVersion and constraint as VersionConstraint returns Boolean:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Constraint satisfaction checking not implemented"

Note: Parse version constraint string
Process called "parse_constraint" that takes constraint_string as String returns VersionConstraint:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Constraint parsing not implemented"

Note: Find latest version matching constraint
Process called "find_latest_matching" that takes available_versions as Array[SemanticVersion] and constraint as VersionConstraint returns SemanticVersion:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Latest matching version finding not implemented"

Note: Bump version according to type
Process called "bump_version" that takes current_version as SemanticVersion and bump_type as VersionBumpType returns SemanticVersion:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Version bumping not implemented"

Note: Generate next version suggestions
Process called "suggest_next_versions" that takes current_version as SemanticVersion returns Dictionary[String, SemanticVersion]:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Version suggestion generation not implemented"

Note: Validate version format
Process called "validate_version_format" that takes version_string as String returns Boolean:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Version format validation not implemented"

Note: Convert version to string representation
Process called "version_to_string" that takes version as SemanticVersion returns String:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Version string conversion not implemented"

Note: Check version compatibility
Process called "are_compatible" that takes version1 as SemanticVersion and version2 as SemanticVersion returns Boolean:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Version compatibility checking not implemented"

Note: Sort versions in order
Process called "sort_versions" that takes versions as Array[SemanticVersion] and ascending as Boolean returns Array[SemanticVersion]:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Version sorting not implemented"

Note: Extract version from Git tags
Process called "extract_version_from_git" that takes tag_pattern as String returns SemanticVersion:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Git version extraction not implemented"
