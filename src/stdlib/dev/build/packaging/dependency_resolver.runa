Note: Resolve dependencies for a package
Process called "resolve_dependencies" that takes resolver as DependencyResolver and root_package as String and version as String returns ResolutionResult:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Dependency resolution not implemented"

Note: Check version constraint satisfaction
Process called "satisfies_constraint" that takes version as String and constraint as VersionConstraint returns Boolean:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Version constraint checking not implemented"

Note: Find compatible version from available versions
Process called "find_compatible_version" that takes available_versions as Array[String] and constraint as VersionConstraint returns String:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Compatible version finding not implemented"

Note: Detect circular dependencies
Process called "detect_circular_dependencies" that takes dependency_graph as Array[DependencyNode] returns Array[Array[String]]:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Circular dependency detection not implemented"

Note: Generate build order from dependency graph
Process called "generate_build_order" that takes dependency_graph as Array[DependencyNode] returns Array[String]:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Build order generation not implemented"

Note: Resolve version conflicts using strategy
Process called "resolve_conflicts" that takes conflicts as Array[DependencyConflict] and strategy as String returns Array[DependencyNode]:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Conflict resolution not implemented"

Note: Validate resolved dependency graph
Process called "validate_resolution" that takes resolution as ResolutionResult returns Array[String]:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Resolution validation not implemented"

Note: Update dependency graph with new constraints
Process called "update_resolution" that takes current_resolution as ResolutionResult and new_constraints as Dictionary[String, VersionConstraint] returns ResolutionResult:
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Resolution updating not implemented"
