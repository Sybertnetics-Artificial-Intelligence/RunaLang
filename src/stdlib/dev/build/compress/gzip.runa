Gzip Compression and Decompression Utilities

This module provides comprehensive gzip compression and decompression functionality for the Runa build system.

Key features and capabilities:
- RFC 1952 compliant gzip compression and decompression
- Configurable compression levels from 1 (fastest) to 9 (best compression)
- Stream-based processing for memory-efficient handling of large files
- Header parsing and metadata extraction from gzip files
- CRC32 integrity verification for data corruption detection
- Multiple compression strategies (default, filtered, huffman-only, RLE, fixed)
- File and in-memory compression operations
- Integration with build pipeline compression requirements
- Cross-platform compatibility with standard gzip utilities
