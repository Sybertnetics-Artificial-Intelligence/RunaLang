Tar Archive Management and Processing Utilities

This module provides comprehensive tar archive creation, extraction, and manipulation functionality for the Runa build system.

Key features and capabilities:
- Support for multiple tar formats (POSIX ustar, GNU tar, pax)
- Compression integration (gzip, bzip2, xz) for compressed tar archives
- File metadata preservation including permissions, timestamps, and ownership
- Streaming archive processing for memory-efficient large archive handling
- Symbolic and hard link support with proper reference handling
- Incremental and differential archive creation capabilities
- Archive validation and integrity checking with error recovery
- Cross-platform compatibility with standard tar utilities
- Random access file extraction without full archive processing
- Error handling approach for robust archive operations
- Memory management considerations for large archive processing
- Concurrency/threading considerations for parallel archive operations
