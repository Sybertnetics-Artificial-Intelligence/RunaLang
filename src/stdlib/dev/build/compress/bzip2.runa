- Block-sorting compression with configurable block sizes (100KB to 900KB)
- Superior compression ratios compared to gzip for many data types
- Multi-threaded compression support for improved performance
- Huffman coding and run-length encoding integration
- Stream-based processing for memory-efficient large file handling
- Error recovery capabilities for partially corrupted archives
- Integration with build pipeline and archive management systems
- Cross-platform compatibility with standard bzip2 utilities
