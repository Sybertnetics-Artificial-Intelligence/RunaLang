- Dynamic load balancing and resource allocation across workers
- Build task scheduling with dependency-aware ordering
- Resource constraint management (CPU, memory, I/O bandwidth)
- Worker failure detection, recovery, and graceful degradation
- Build progress monitoring and real-time statistics
- Task priority scheduling and critical path optimization
- Build result aggregation and error handling
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Error handling approach for robust parallel execution
- Memory management considerations for concurrent build processes
