Incremental Build System and Change Detection

This module provides comprehensive incremental build capabilities for the Runa build system, enabling efficient rebuilds by tracking file changes and dependencies.

Key features and capabilities:
- File modification tracking with checksums and timestamps
- Dependency graph construction and maintenance for precise change propagation
- Minimal rebuild computation based on actual file changes
- Build state persistence across build sessions
- Stale artifact detection and cleanup
- Incremental compilation optimization strategies
- Change impact analysis and affected target calculation
- Build consistency validation and verification
- Ignore pattern support for excluded files
- Error handling approach for robust incremental builds
- Memory management considerations for large codebases
- Concurrency/threading considerations for parallel change detection
