Build Artifact Management and Storage System

This module provides comprehensive build artifact management capabilities for the Runa build system, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, versioning, and lifecycle management of build outputs.

Key features and capabilities:
- Build artifact storage with multiple backend support (filesystem, cloud, remote)
- Artifact versioning and dependency tracking with comprehensive metadata management
- Repository management with configurable retention policies and cleanup strategies
- Artifact indexing and search capabilities for efficient artifact discovery
- Integrity verification and checksum validation for data corruption detection
- Distributed artifact storage with replication and synchronization
- Artifact lifecycle management with automated cleanup and archival
- Integration with build systems and continuous integration pipelines
- Cross-platform artifact management with platform-specific optimizations
- Error handling approach for robust artifact operations
- Memory management considerations for large artifact processing
- Concurrency/threading considerations for parallel artifact operations
