Build Dependency Graph Construction and Management

This module provides comprehensive build dependency graph construction, analysis, and optimization functionality for the Runa build system.

Key features and capabilities:
- Directed acyclic graph (DAG) construction for build target dependencies
- Topological sorting for optimal build execution ordering
- Circular dependency detection and resolution strategies
- Critical path analysis for build time optimization
- Parallel execution group generation for multi-threaded builds
- Incremental build graph optimization based on file changes
- Graph visualization and export capabilities for debugging
- Build target metadata management and validation
- Dependency rule engine for complex build scenarios
- Error handling approach for robust graph operations
- Memory management considerations for large build graphs
- Concurrency/threading considerations for parallel graph processing
