Networking Library Type Stubs and Interface Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for networking library types and
operations, serving as interface definitions for external language bindings
and code generation tools that need to understand Runa's networking API.

Key features and capabilities:
- Socket operation stubs (TCP, UDP, Unix domain sockets)
- HTTP client/server stubs with modern protocol support
- WebSocket operation stubs for real-time bidirectional communication
- DNS resolution stubs for hostname to IP address translation
- Network interface stubs for system network configuration
- Protocol implementation stubs (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Performance characteristics for different networking patterns
- Integration points with operating system networking stack
- Standards compliance with RFC specifications and protocols
- Platform-specific considerations for socket implementations
- Security considerations for network communication and encryption
- Error handling approach for network failures and timeouts
- Memory management considerations for network buffers and connections
- Concurrency/threading considerations for multiple simultaneous connections
