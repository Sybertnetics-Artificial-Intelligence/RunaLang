Collections Library Type Stubs and Interface Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for collections library types and
operations, serving as interface definitions for external language bindings
and code generation tools that need to understand Runa's collections API.

Key features and capabilities:
- Core collection type stubs (List, Set, Map, Queue, Stack, Deque)
- Iterator and enumeration pattern stubs for collection traversal
- Collection transformation operation stubs (map, filter, reduce, sort)
- Concurrent and thread-safe collection type stubs
- Collection validation and comparison operation stubs
- Streaming and lazy evaluation collection stubs
- Performance characteristics documentation for each collection type
- Integration points with memory management and garbage collection
- Standards compliance with functional programming paradigms
- Platform-specific optimization hints for collection implementations
- Security considerations for collection bounds checking
- Error handling approach for collection operations
- Memory management considerations for large collections
- Concurrency/threading considerations for shared collections
