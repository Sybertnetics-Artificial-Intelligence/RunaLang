Input/Output Library Type Stubs and Interface Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for I/O library types and operations,
serving as interface definitions for external language bindings and code
generation tools that need to understand Runa's I/O API.

Key features and capabilities:
- File I/O operation stubs (read, write, append, truncate)
- Stream processing stubs (FileStream, BufferedStream, MemoryStream)
- Console I/O stubs (input, output, error, formatting)
- Binary and text file processing with encoding support
- Path manipulation and directory operation stubs
- Asynchronous I/O operation stubs for non-blocking operations
- Performance characteristics for different I/O strategies
- Integration points with filesystem and operating system
- Standards compliance with POSIX and platform-specific APIs
- Platform-specific considerations for file systems and permissions
- Security considerations for file access and privilege escalation
- Error handling approach for I/O failures and timeouts
- Memory management considerations for large file operations
- Concurrency/threading considerations for shared file access
