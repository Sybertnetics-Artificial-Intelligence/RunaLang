Asynchronous Programming Library Type Stubs and Interface Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for async/await library types and
operations, serving as interface definitions for external language bindings
and code generation tools that need to understand Runa's async API.

Key features and capabilities:
- Future and Promise type stubs for asynchronous computation results
- Async/await operation stubs for non-blocking program execution
- Task and executor stubs for concurrent task management
- Channel and synchronization primitive stubs for thread communication
- Timer and delay operation stubs for time-based scheduling
- Event loop and reactor stubs for I/O event handling
- Performance characteristics for different async patterns
- Integration points with operating system async I/O facilities
- Standards compliance with async/await programming patterns
- Platform-specific considerations for thread scheduling and I/O
- Security considerations for concurrent access and data races
- Error handling approach for async operation failures and timeouts
- Memory management considerations for async state and continuations
- Concurrency/threading considerations inherent to async programming
