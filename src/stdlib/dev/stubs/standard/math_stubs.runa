Mathematics Library Type Stubs and Interface Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for mathematics library types and
operations, serving as interface definitions for external language bindings
and code generation tools that need to understand Runa's mathematical API.

Key features and capabilities:
- Basic arithmetic operation stubs (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo)
- Trigonometric function stubs (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan)
- Logarithmic and exponential function stubs (log, ln, exp, pow)
- Statistical operation stubs (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
- Linear algebra stubs (Matrix, Vector operations, determinant, eigenvalues)
- Random number generation stubs (uniform, normal, discrete distributions)
- Mathematical constants and precision handling
- Integration points with numerical computing libraries
- Standards compliance with IEEE 754 floating point arithmetic
- Platform-specific optimizations for mathematical operations
- Security considerations for cryptographic mathematical operations
- Error handling approach for mathematical domain errors
- Memory management considerations for large mathematical computations
- Concurrency/threading considerations for parallel mathematical operations
