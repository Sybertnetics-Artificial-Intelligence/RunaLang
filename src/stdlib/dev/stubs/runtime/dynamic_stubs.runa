Runtime-Generated Type Stubs and Dynamic Analysis Interface Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for runtime-generated type stubs and dynamic
analysis systems, serving as interface definitions for runtime type introspection,
dynamic code generation, and adaptive type discovery in live running systems.

Key features and capabilities:
- Runtime type introspection and dynamic analysis of live object instances
- Dynamic stub generation from runtime observations and usage patterns
- Real-time code generation and compilation of type definitions
- Runtime type inference from execution traces and method call patterns
- Dynamic interface discovery through runtime object inspection
- Performance monitoring and optimization of dynamic analysis processes
- Mathematical foundations for statistical type inference and pattern recognition
- Performance characteristics for different introspection and generation strategies
- Integration points with compiler infrastructure and type checking systems
- Standards compliance with reflection APIs and dynamic language protocols
- Platform-specific considerations for runtime type information and metadata
- Security considerations for dynamic code execution and sandboxing
- Error handling approach for runtime failures and type inference errors
- Memory management considerations for dynamic object tracking and stub caching
- Concurrency/threading considerations for multi-threaded runtime analysis
