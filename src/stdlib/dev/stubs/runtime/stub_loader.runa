Runtime Stub Loading and Dynamic Dependency Management Interface Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for runtime stub loading systems,
serving as interface definitions for dynamic stub loading, dependency resolution,
version management, and caching in live running systems.

Key features and capabilities:

- Advanced dependency resolution with conflict detection and automatic resolution
- Multi-repository stub discovery with authentication and security validation
- Version-aware stub loading with semantic versioning and compatibility checking
- High-performance caching with intelligent eviction and warming strategies
- Hot reloading support for seamless development and runtime updates
- Security validation with signature verification and trust management
- Performance monitoring with bottleneck detection and optimization recommendations
- Mathematical foundations for dependency graph analysis and resolution algorithms
- Performance characteristics for different loading and caching strategies
- Integration points with package managers and runtime environments
- Standards compliance with package management protocols and security frameworks
- Platform-specific considerations for different runtime architectures and file systems
- Security considerations for code injection prevention and sandboxing
- Error handling approach for loading failures and dependency conflicts
- Memory management considerations for stub caching and dependency tracking
- Concurrency/threading considerations for parallel loading and thread-safe operations
