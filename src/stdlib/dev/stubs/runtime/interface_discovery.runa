Runtime Interface Discovery and Dynamic Interface Analysis Interface Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for runtime interface discovery systems,
serving as interface definitions for dynamic interface analysis, method signature
introspection, and protocol conformance checking in live running systems.

Key features and capabilities:
- Dynamic interface discovery through runtime object inspection and analysis
- Method signature extraction and validation from live object instances
- Trait implementation detection and conformance verification at runtime
- Type relationship mapping and interface hierarchy construction
- Protocol conformance checking and compatibility validation
- Runtime interface compatibility verification and structural analysis
- Dynamic dispatch table generation and method resolution optimization
- Mathematical foundations for interface compatibility scoring and analysis
- Performance characteristics for different discovery and analysis strategies
- Integration points with type systems and runtime environments
- Standards compliance with interface definition languages and protocols
- Platform-specific considerations for different runtime architectures
- Security considerations for interface introspection and access control
- Error handling approach for discovery failures and invalid interface definitions
- Memory management considerations for interface metadata and relationship graphs
- Concurrency/threading considerations for concurrent interface discovery and analysis
