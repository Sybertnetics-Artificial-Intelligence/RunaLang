Runtime Type Registry and Dynamic Type Management Interface Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for runtime type registry systems,
serving as interface definitions for dynamic type registration, lookup, and
management of type information in live running systems.

Key features and capabilities:
- Centralized registry for all runtime type information and metadata
- Dynamic type registration and unregistration during program execution
- Type lookup and resolution services for runtime type checking
- Type hierarchy management and inheritance relationship tracking
- Generic type instantiation and parameterized type management
- Type aliasing and name resolution for flexible type referencing
- Mathematical foundations for type relationship analysis and constraint solving
- Performance characteristics for different type lookup and storage strategies
- Integration points with compiler type systems and runtime environments
- Standards compliance with type system specifications and language semantics
- Platform-specific considerations for different runtime architectures
- Security considerations for dynamic type loading and validation
- Error handling approach for type conflicts and registration failures
- Memory management considerations for type metadata and relationship graphs
- Concurrency/threading considerations for concurrent type registration and lookup
