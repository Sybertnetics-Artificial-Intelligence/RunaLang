Documentation Extractor API

This module provides comprehensive documentation extraction capabilities for stub generation.

Key features and capabilities:
- Documentation extraction from comments and docstrings
- Code example parsing and validation
- Reference resolution and cross-linking
- Markup processing and format conversion
- Performance monitoring and extraction statistics
- Integration with stub generation pipeline
- Error handling for extraction failures
- Memory management for documentation data
- Thread-safe documentation extraction coordination
