Stub Validator API

This module provides comprehensive stub validation capabilities for ensuring generated stubs are correct and complete.

Key features and capabilities:
- Stub syntax and semantic validation
- Type accuracy and signature completeness checking
- Documentation and example validation
- Compatibility and performance validation
- Performance monitoring and validation statistics
- Integration with stub generation pipeline
- Error handling for validation failures
- Memory management for validation data
- Thread-safe stub validation coordination
