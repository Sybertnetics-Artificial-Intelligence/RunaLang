External Database Library Interface Stubs and Type Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for external database library interfaces,
serving as type definitions and API contracts for database connectivity, query
execution, and data management operations across different database systems.

Key features and capabilities:
- Multi-database support (SQL and NoSQL: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis)
- Connection pooling and management for efficient resource utilization
- Transaction support with ACID compliance and isolation levels
- Query builder interface for type-safe SQL/NoSQL query construction
- Object-relational mapping (ORM) pattern stubs for data modeling
- Migration and schema management operation stubs
- Mathematical foundations for query optimization and indexing strategies
- Performance characteristics for different database operations and access patterns
- Integration points with connection pooling libraries and database drivers
- Standards compliance with SQL ANSI standards and database-specific protocols
- Platform-specific considerations for different database engine implementations
- Security considerations for SQL injection prevention and access control
- Error handling approach for connection failures and query execution errors
- Memory management considerations for large result sets and connection pools
- Concurrency/threading considerations for multi-user database access
