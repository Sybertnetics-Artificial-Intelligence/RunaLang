External GUI Toolkit Library Interface Stubs and Type Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for external GUI toolkit library interfaces,
serving as type definitions and API contracts for graphical user interface development,
window management, event handling, and modern desktop application patterns.

Key features and capabilities:
- Cross-platform GUI application framework with native look and feel
- Window management and dialog systems for desktop applications
- Widget hierarchy and layout management for responsive interfaces
- Event handling system for user interactions (mouse, keyboard, touch)
- Graphics rendering and custom drawing capabilities with hardware acceleration
- Theming and styling system for consistent visual design
- Mathematical foundations for coordinate systems, transformations, and animation
- Performance characteristics for different rendering backends and platforms
- Integration points with operating system native UI frameworks
- Standards compliance with platform-specific UI guidelines and accessibility
- Platform-specific considerations for Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop environments
- Security considerations for file access, clipboard operations, and system integration
- Error handling approach for UI exceptions and resource management
- Memory management considerations for graphics resources and widget trees
- Concurrency/threading considerations for UI thread safety and responsiveness
