External Web Framework Library Interface Stubs and Type Definitions

This module provides stub implementations for external web framework library interfaces,
serving as type definitions and API contracts for web application development, HTTP
server functionality, routing, middleware, and modern web development patterns.

Key features and capabilities:
- HTTP server and request/response handling with modern protocol support
- URL routing and path parameter extraction for RESTful API design
- Middleware pipeline for request processing and authentication
- Template engine integration for server-side HTML rendering
- Session management and authentication/authorization systems
- Static file serving with caching and compression optimization
- Mathematical foundations for load balancing and performance optimization
- Performance characteristics for different web server architectures
- Integration points with web server software and reverse proxies
- Standards compliance with HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 protocols
- Platform-specific considerations for different operating systems
- Security considerations for web application vulnerabilities and HTTPS
- Error handling approach for HTTP errors and exception management
- Memory management considerations for high-traffic web applications
- Concurrency/threading considerations for handling multiple simultaneous requests
