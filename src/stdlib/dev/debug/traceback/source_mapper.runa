handles source maps, and provides source context for debugging operations.

Key features and capabilities:
- Execution address to source location mapping
- Source map parsing and processing
- Multi-language source mapping support
- Inlined code and optimization handling
- Source context retrieval and formatting
- Dynamic source mapping for interpreted code
- Source file caching and management
- Cross-platform path handling and normalization
- Version control integration for source retrieval
- Source diff and change tracking
- Performance-optimized mapping algorithms
- Memory-efficient source storage
- Integration with build systems and compilers
- Support for transformed and generated code
- Historical source version management
