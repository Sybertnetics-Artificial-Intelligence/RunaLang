Symbol Name Resolution and Debugging Information

This module provides comprehensive symbol name resolution capabilities for
debugging and stack trace analysis. It resolves function names, variable names,
and debugging symbols from various sources including debug info and symbol tables.

Key features and capabilities:
- Function name resolution from addresses and identifiers
- Variable name resolution and scope analysis
- Debug symbol loading and management
- Source code location mapping from symbols
- Cross-platform symbol format support
- Dynamic symbol resolution during runtime
- Symbol caching and performance optimization
- Integration with compiler debugging information
- Support for stripped and optimized binaries
- Symbol versioning and compatibility management
- Remote symbol server integration
- Symbol validation and integrity checking
- Performance-optimized symbol lookup
