Core Error Types and Handling Framework

This module provides the foundational error handling infrastructure for the entire
Runa language ecosystem. It defines base error types, severity levels, error contexts,
and core error propagation mechanisms.

Key features and capabilities:
- Base Error type with message, code, source location tracking
- Error severity levels (Fatal, Error, Warning, Info, Debug)
- Error context and metadata storage for debugging
- Core throwing and catching mechanisms
- Integration with panic handler for unrecoverable errors
- Memory-safe error propagation across function boundaries
- Thread-safe error handling for concurrent operations
- Structured error data support for machine processing
- Error filtering and classification systems
- Performance-optimized error handling paths
- Integration points with logging and debugging systems
- Standards compliance with structured error formats
- Cross-platform error handling consistency
- Security considerations for error information leakage
- Zero-allocation error handling for performance-critical paths
- Comprehensive error validation and sanitization
