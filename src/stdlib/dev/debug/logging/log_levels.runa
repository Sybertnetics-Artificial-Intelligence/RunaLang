and provides level-based filtering and configuration.

Key features and capabilities:
- Standard log levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
- Custom log level creation and management
- Dynamic log level configuration and adjustment
- Level-based filtering with performance optimization
- Hierarchical log level relationships
- Log level inheritance and propagation
- Performance-optimized level checking
- Thread-safe level configuration
- Integration with logging frameworks
- Log level analytics and reporting
- Configuration persistence and restoration
- Environment-based level configuration
- Runtime level adjustment and monitoring
