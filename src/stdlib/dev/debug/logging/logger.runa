processing, formatting, filtering, and output routing. It serves as the
central component of the logging framework.

Key features and capabilities:
- High-performance structured logging with key-value pairs
- Multiple output targets (console, file, network, database)
- Asynchronous logging for minimal performance impact
- Log message formatting and templating
- Integration with error handling and debugging systems
- Thread-safe logging operations
- Memory-efficient message buffering
- Log rotation and archival management
- Real-time log streaming and monitoring
- Custom log processors and middleware
- Performance metrics and logging analytics
- Configuration hot-reloading
- Distributed logging coordination
- Security and privacy protection
- Compliance with logging standards
