- Configurable serialization methods and compression algorithms
- End-to-end encryption with pluggable security providers
- Custom header fields and metadata support for protocol extensions
- Service-oriented architecture with method registration and routing
- Middleware and interceptor framework for cross-cutting concerns
- Schema validation for request/response message structures
- Rate limiting and throttling capabilities per method or service
- Authentication and authorization integration with custom providers
- Connection management with reliability levels and flow control
- Request correlation and distributed tracing support
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection framework
- Protocol documentation generation for API consumers
- Hot-swappable protocol and transport implementations
- Streaming support for real-time and long-running operations
- Error handling with custom error codes and recovery strategies
- Load balancing and failover mechanisms for high availability
- Protocol negotiation and version compatibility management
- Memory-efficient message processing with zero-copy optimizations
- Async/await support for non-blocking operations
- Error handling approach for robust custom RPC communication
- Memory management considerations for extensible framework design
