- Interceptor framework for cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, auth)
- Channel state monitoring and connectivity management
- Compression support (gzip, deflate) for bandwidth optimization
- Deadline propagation and context cancellation for distributed tracing
- Error handling with detailed gRPC status codes and messages
- Connection pooling and multiplexing for efficient resource utilization
- Service discovery integration and dynamic endpoint resolution
- Performance monitoring and call statistics collection
- Async/await support for non-blocking RPC operations
- Error handling approach for robust RPC communication
