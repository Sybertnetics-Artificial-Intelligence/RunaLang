Redis Key-Value Store Compatibility Layer

This module provides compatibility layer for Redis in-memory data structure store functionality in Runa.

Key features and capabilities:
- In-memory key-value store with persistence options
- Rich data structures (strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, streams)
- Pub/Sub messaging system for real-time communication
- Lua scripting for atomic operations
- Transactions with MULTI/EXEC commands
- Master-slave replication and Redis Cluster support
- Expiration and eviction policies
- Pipelining and connection pooling for performance
- Geospatial indexing and commands
- Streams for event sourcing and messaging
- Performance optimized with connection pooling and pipelining
- Standards compliance with Redis protocol (RESP)
- Platform-specific optimizations for different Redis versions
- Security considerations for authentication and network access
- Comprehensive error handling for Redis operations
- Memory management optimized for in-memory operations
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent Redis access
