MongoDB Document Database Compatibility Layer

This module provides compatibility layer for MongoDB document database functionality in Runa.

Key features and capabilities:
- Document-oriented NoSQL database with flexible schema
- BSON data format with rich type system support
- Replica set and sharding for high availability and scalability
- Aggregation pipeline for complex data processing
- GridFS for large file storage and retrieval
- Change streams for real-time data monitoring
- Text search and geospatial indexing capabilities
- Transactions with multi-document ACID guarantees
- Authentication and authorization with role-based access
- Performance optimized with connection pooling and indexing
- Standards compliance with MongoDB wire protocol
- Platform-specific optimizations for different MongoDB versions
- Security considerations for authentication and data encryption
- Comprehensive error handling for database operations
- Memory management optimized for document processing
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent database access
