SQLAlchemy ORM Compatibility Layer

This module provides compatibility layer for SQLAlchemy object-relational mapping functionality in Runa.

Key features and capabilities:
- Complete ORM with declarative base classes and model definitions
- Database engine abstraction with connection pooling and management
- Session management with transaction support and unit of work pattern
- Query API with filtering, joining, ordering, and aggregation
- Relationship mapping including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many
- Schema management with table creation, migration, and introspection
- Advanced querying with lazy loading, eager loading, and subqueries
- Connection pooling and database dialect abstraction
- Metadata reflection and database schema inspection
- Index and constraint management for query optimization
- Bulk operations and batch processing for performance
- Event system for database hooks and lifecycle management
- Migration support and schema versioning integration
- Performance optimized with lazy loading and connection pooling
- Standards compliance with SQL standards and database-specific features
- Platform-specific optimizations for different database backends
- Security considerations for SQL injection prevention and access control
- Comprehensive error handling for database and ORM operations
- Memory management optimized for large datasets and object graphs
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent ORM usage
