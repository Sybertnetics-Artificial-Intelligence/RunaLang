MySQL Database Compatibility Layer

This module provides compatibility layer for MySQL database functionality in Runa.

Key features and capabilities:
- Full MySQL protocol compliance with version-specific optimizations
- Connection pooling with load balancing and failover support
- Prepared statements and stored procedures with parameter binding
- Transaction management with isolation level control
- MySQL-specific features (JSON columns, full-text search, spatial data)
- Replication and clustering support for high availability
- Performance Schema integration for query optimization
- Bulk operations and batch processing capabilities
- SSL/TLS encryption and authentication methods
- Character set and collation handling
- MySQL 8.0+ features including CTEs, window functions, and roles
- Binary logging and point-in-time recovery support
- Performance optimized with connection pooling and query caching
- Standards compliance with MySQL wire protocol and SQL extensions
- Platform-specific optimizations for different MySQL versions
- Security considerations for authentication and data encryption
- Comprehensive error handling for database and network operations
- Memory management optimized for large result sets
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent database access
