Alembic Database Migration Compatibility Layer

This module provides compatibility layer for Alembic database migration and schema versioning functionality in Runa.

Key features and capabilities:
- Complete database migration management with version control
- Schema evolution and migration script generation
- Revision history tracking and branching support
- Automatic migration generation from model changes
- Migration operations including table, column, and constraint modifications
- Multi-database and schema support with environment management
- Batch operations for databases requiring table recreation
- Migration rollback and forward progression capabilities
- Branch merging and revision dependency management
- SQL generation and offline migration script creation
- Environment configuration and template customization
- Migration testing and validation frameworks
- Performance optimized with efficient migration execution
- Standards compliance with database-specific DDL syntax
- Platform-specific optimizations for different database backends
- Security considerations for migration script validation and execution
- Comprehensive error handling for migration operations and rollbacks
- Memory management optimized for large schema modifications
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent migration environments
