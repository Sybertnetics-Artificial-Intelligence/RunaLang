SQLite Database Compatibility Layer

This module provides compatibility layer for SQLite database functionality in Runa.

Key features and capabilities:
- Full SQLite engine integration with version-specific optimizations
- In-memory and file-based database support
- Transaction management with savepoints and nested transactions
- SQLite-specific features (FTS, R-Tree, JSON1 extension)
- User-defined functions and aggregates
- Virtual table support and custom modules
- WAL mode and concurrent access optimization
- Backup and restore capabilities
- PRAGMA statements and database introspection
- Custom collation sequences and SQL functions
- Performance optimized with prepared statements and connection pooling
- Standards compliance with SQL standards and SQLite extensions
- Platform-specific optimizations for different architectures
- Security considerations for database file access and SQL injection
- Comprehensive error handling for database operations
- Memory management optimized for embedded database operations
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent database access
