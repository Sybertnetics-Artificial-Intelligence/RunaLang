- File upload and download with streaming capabilities
- JSON and form data encoding/decoding
- SSL/TLS certificate verification and custom certificates
- Proxy support with authentication
- Request and response hooks for middleware functionality
- Timeout configuration and connection management
- Response status code checking and error handling
- Cookie jar management with domain and path handling
- Redirect handling with history tracking
- Performance optimized with connection pooling and keep-alive
- Standards compliance with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
- Platform-specific optimizations for different network conditions
- Security considerations for SSL/TLS and authentication
- Comprehensive error handling for network and HTTP errors
