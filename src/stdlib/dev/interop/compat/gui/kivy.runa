Kivy GUI Framework Compatibility Layer

This module provides compatibility layer for Kivy GUI framework operations and mobile-first UI development.

Key features and capabilities:
- Complete Kivy widget library (Widget, Button, Label, TextInput, etc.)
- Touch-based interaction and gesture recognition
- Multi-touch support and advanced input handling
- OpenGL ES 2.0 graphics rendering
- Cross-platform mobile and desktop deployment
- Animation system with transitions and effects
- Custom widget creation and inheritance
- Event-driven architecture with clock scheduling
- Screen management and navigation
- Error handling for Kivy operations
- Memory management for widget lifecycle
- Graphics instruction optimization
