PyQt GUI Framework Compatibility Layer

This module provides compatibility layer for PyQt GUI framework operations and Qt widget management.

Key features and capabilities:
- Complete Qt widget hierarchy (QWidget, QPushButton, QLabel, etc.)
- Signal and slot mechanism for event handling
- Advanced layout management (QHBoxLayout, QVBoxLayout, QGridLayout)
- Model-View architecture support
- Custom painting with QPainter
- Threading support with QThread
- Style sheets for appearance customization
- Internationalization support
- Error handling for Qt operations
- Memory management for Qt objects
- Cross-platform native look and feel
