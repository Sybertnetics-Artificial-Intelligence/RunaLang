Tkinter GUI Framework Compatibility Layer

This module provides compatibility layer for Tkinter GUI framework operations and widget management.

Key features and capabilities:
- Complete Tkinter widget hierarchy (Button, Label, Entry, Canvas, etc.)
- Window management and geometry control
- Event handling and callback mechanisms
- Layout managers (pack, grid, place)
- Canvas drawing operations
- Menu and dialog systems
- Cross-platform GUI compatibility
- Widget styling and theming
- Error handling for GUI operations
- Memory management for widget lifecycle
- Thread-safe GUI operations
