PySide GUI Framework Compatibility Layer

This module provides compatibility layer for PySide GUI framework operations and Qt widget management.

Key features and capabilities:
- Complete PySide6 widget library (QWidget, QPushButton, QLabel, etc.)
- Modern Qt6 signal and slot mechanism
- Advanced layout management with size policies
- Model-View-Controller architecture
- Custom painting with QPainter and Qt Graphics Framework
- Multi-threading support with QThread and QRunnable
- Style sheets and QML integration
- Internationalization with QTranslator
- Error handling for PySide operations
- Memory management for Qt object lifecycle
- Cross-platform native look and feel
