Note:
ONNX Model Format Compatibility Layer for Runa

This module provides comprehensive compatibility for the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)
format, enabling seamless interoperability with neural network models across different
frameworks and platforms. ONNX serves as a universal standard for representing deep learning
models, allowing for model portability and optimization across various deployment environments.

The ONNX compatibility layer supports:
• Model format I/O (loading, saving, validation)  
• Inference session management and execution
• Model optimization and quantization
• Cross-framework model conversion (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
• Shape inference and type checking
• Model composition and subgraph extraction
• Runtime provider management (CPU, CUDA, TensorRT, etc.)

Performance characteristics:
• Model loading: O(n) where n is model size in bytes
• Inference execution: O(m) where m is computation complexity
• Shape inference: O(g) where g is graph size
• Model optimization: O(g log g) for graph transformation passes

Memory management:
• Efficient tensor memory pooling for large model inference
• Lazy loading support for models with external data
• Configurable memory arena allocation strategies
• Automatic garbage collection for intermediate computations

Thread safety: All ONNX operations are designed to be thread-safe for concurrent
model loading and inference across multiple execution contexts.

Integration patterns:
• Seamless integration with Runa tensor operations
• Native support for distributed inference scenarios  
• Automatic optimization based on target hardware capabilities
• Built-in profiling and performance monitoring hooks
