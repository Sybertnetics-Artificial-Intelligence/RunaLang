TensorBoard Visualization Compatibility Layer for Runa
============================================================================

This module provides comprehensive compatibility for TensorBoard, Google's powerful
visualization toolkit for machine learning experimentation. TensorBoard enables
researchers and practitioners to visualize training metrics, model graphs,
hyperparameter exploration, and various data types throughout the ML development lifecycle.

The TensorBoard compatibility layer supports:
• Scalar metrics logging and visualization (loss, accuracy, custom metrics)
• Histogram and distribution tracking for weights and gradients
• Image, audio, and video logging for media-rich experiments
• Graph visualization for model architecture analysis
• Embedding projections for high-dimensional data exploration
• Hyperparameter optimization tracking and comparison
• Custom scalar layouts and advanced visualization configurations

Performance characteristics:
• Event writing: O(1) for individual metric logging
• File I/O: Batched writing with configurable flush intervals
• Memory usage: Configurable queue sizes for async writing
• Visualization: Real-time dashboard updates with efficient data streaming

Memory management:
• Configurable event file size limits and rotation policies
• Efficient binary protocol buffer serialization for compact storage
• Automatic cleanup of old experiment data based on retention policies
• Memory-mapped file access for large-scale experiment browsing

Thread safety: All TensorBoard operations support concurrent logging from
multiple threads and processes with atomic file operations and proper locking.

Integration patterns:
• Seamless integration with Runa tensor operations and training loops
• Plugin architecture for custom visualization components
• Distributed training support with automatic worker coordination
• Cloud storage backends for collaborative experiment sharing
