Kubernetes Orchestration Compatibility Layer

This module provides Kubernetes orchestration platform compatibility and API functionality
for seamless integration with Kubernetes clusters and workload management from Runa applications.

Key features and capabilities:
- Kubernetes API server integration and cluster management
- Pod, Deployment, Service, and Ingress resource operations
- ConfigMap and Secret configuration management
- Persistent Volume and Storage Class operations
- Namespace and Resource Quota management
- Helm chart deployment and package management
- Custom Resource Definition (CRD) support
- Kubernetes monitoring and observability integration
- Multi-cluster management and federation support
- Error handling with Kubernetes-specific error codes
- Memory management for large manifest operations
- Concurrent resource operations with proper rate limits
- kubectl compatibility layer for existing tooling
