AWS Services Compatibility Layer

This module provides AWS-compatible cloud services interface and SDK functionality
for seamless integration with Amazon Web Services from Runa applications.

Key features and capabilities:
- AWS service authentication and credential management
- S3 object storage operations and bucket management
- EC2 compute instance lifecycle management
- Lambda serverless function deployment and execution
- DynamoDB NoSQL database operations
- CloudFormation infrastructure as code support
- IAM security and access management integration
- CloudWatch monitoring and logging integration
- Cross-service integration patterns
- Error handling with AWS-specific error codes
- Memory management for large object transfers
- Concurrent operations with proper rate limiting
- AWS SDK compatibility layer for existing tooling
