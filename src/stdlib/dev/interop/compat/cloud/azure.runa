Azure Services Compatibility Layer

This module provides Microsoft Azure-compatible cloud services interface and SDK functionality
for seamless integration with Azure cloud platform from Runa applications.

Key features and capabilities:
- Azure Active Directory authentication and identity management
- Azure Storage (Blob, Table, Queue, Files) operations
- Azure Compute (Virtual Machines, Container Instances) management
- Azure Functions serverless compute platform
- Azure Cosmos DB multi-model database operations
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template deployment
- Azure Key Vault secrets and certificate management
- Azure Monitor logging and telemetry integration
- Cross-service Azure integration patterns
- Error handling with Azure-specific error codes
- Memory management for large data transfers
- Concurrent operations with proper throttling
- Azure SDK compatibility for existing tooling
