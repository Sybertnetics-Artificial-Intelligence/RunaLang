Docker Container Compatibility Layer

This module provides Docker container platform compatibility and API functionality
for seamless integration with Docker containers and registry services from Runa applications.

Key features and capabilities:
- Docker Engine API integration and container lifecycle management
- Container image building, pulling, and pushing operations
- Docker Compose multi-container application orchestration
- Docker Registry integration for image distribution
- Network and volume management for containerized applications
- Container monitoring and resource management
- Docker Swarm cluster orchestration support
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment integration
- Cross-platform Docker deployment patterns
- Error handling with Docker-specific error codes
- Memory management for container operations
- Concurrent container operations with proper resource limits
- Docker CLI compatibility layer for existing tooling
