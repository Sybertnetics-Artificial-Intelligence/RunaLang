Google Cloud Platform Compatibility Layer

This module provides Google Cloud Platform-compatible services interface and SDK functionality
for seamless integration with GCP services from Runa applications.

Key features and capabilities:
- Google Cloud service authentication and identity management
- Cloud Storage bucket and object operations
- Compute Engine instance lifecycle management
- Cloud Functions serverless compute platform
- Firestore/Cloud SQL database operations
- Cloud Resource Manager project management
- Cloud IAM security and access control
- Cloud Monitoring and logging integration
- Cross-service GCP integration patterns
- Error handling with GCP-specific error codes
- Memory management for large data transfers
- Concurrent operations with proper rate limiting
- Google Cloud SDK compatibility layer
