- Text rendering, annotations, and mathematical expressions
- Interactive features and animation support
- Multiple output formats (PNG, PDF, SVG, EPS) with vector graphics
- 3D plotting capabilities for scientific visualization
- Integration with scientific data structures and analysis pipelines
- Performance optimized rendering using Runa's graphics libraries
- Cross-platform compatibility with native rendering backends
- Standards compliance with Matplotlib API conventions
- Platform-specific optimizations for different graphics systems
- Security considerations for safe file I/O and rendering
