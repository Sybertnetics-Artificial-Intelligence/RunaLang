Protocol Buffers Serialization System

This module provides comprehensive Protocol Buffers (protobuf) serialization support for cross-language communication in Runa interoperability systems.

Key features and capabilities:
- Automated protobuf schema generation from Runa type definitions
- High-performance binary serialization and deserialization
- Multi-version protocol support (proto2 and proto3 syntax)
- Cross-language code generation for multiple target languages
- Schema evolution and backward compatibility management
- Service definition support for RPC and API communication
- JSON/protobuf interconversion for web integration
- Field validation and constraint enforcement
- Custom field options and metadata handling
- Schema optimization for performance and size efficiency
- Documentation generation from schema definitions
- Import resolution and dependency management
- Wire format compatibility with standard protobuf implementations
- Streaming and incremental serialization support
- Performance optimization with zero-copy deserialization where possible
- Error handling approach for robust serialization operations
- Memory management considerations for efficient data processing
- Concurrency/threading considerations for thread-safe serialization
