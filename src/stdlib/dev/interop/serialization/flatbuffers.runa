- Streaming and incremental construction for large datasets
- Validation and integrity checking for robust data handling
- JSON interoperability for web integration and debugging
- Buffer reuse and memory pooling for high-performance scenarios
- Alignment control and memory layout optimization
- Union types and polymorphism support for complex data structures
- Namespace organization and modular schema management
- Performance monitoring and access pattern analysis
- Error handling approach for robust serialization operations
