- Service-oriented architecture with interface definition language
- Code generation for multiple target programming languages
- Asynchronous and synchronous RPC communication patterns
- Exception handling and propagation across language boundaries
- Versioning support for schema evolution and compatibility
- Connection pooling and load balancing for scalable services
- SSL/TLS security support for secure communication channels
- Multiplexed services for efficient connection utilization
- Annotation system for custom metadata and behavior
- Union types and optional fields for flexible data modeling
- Performance monitoring and RPC call statistics
- Error handling approach for robust RPC operations
