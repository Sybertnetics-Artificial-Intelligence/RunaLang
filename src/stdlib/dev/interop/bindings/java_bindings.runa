- JNI native method generation with C wrapper functions
- Java class and interface generation with proper inheritance hierarchies
- Exception handling integration with Java exception system
- Type mapping and conversion between Runa and Java type systems
- Memory management integration with Java garbage collection
- Build system integration with Maven and Gradle
- Javadoc generation for comprehensive API documentation
- Annotation support for modern Java frameworks and tools
- Resource management with try-with-resources pattern support
- Multi-version Java support (Java 8, 11, 17, 21)
- Performance optimization for efficient JNI call overhead reduction
- Thread safety integration with Java concurrency utilities
- Error handling approach for robust Java interoperability
- Memory management considerations for Java-Runa data safety
- Concurrency/threading considerations for JVM thread compatibility
