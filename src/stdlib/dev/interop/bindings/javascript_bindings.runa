- Dual-target support for Node.js server-side and browser environments
- TypeScript definition generation for enhanced development experience
- Async/await pattern support for non-blocking operations
- Callback and promise integration for JavaScript-style asynchronous programming
- Native addon generation using Node.js N-API for high-performance bindings
- WebAssembly compilation for universal JavaScript compatibility
- Package.json and npm ecosystem integration for easy distribution
- JSDoc generation for comprehensive API documentation
- Error handling with proper JavaScript exception mapping and propagation
- Memory management integration for safe JavaScript-Runa data exchange
- Event-driven programming support with JavaScript event emitters
- Build system integration with webpack, rollup, and other bundlers
- Performance optimization for efficient cross-language function calls
- Error handling approach for robust binding operations
- Memory management considerations for JavaScript-Runa data safety
- Concurrency/threading considerations for JavaScript event loop compatibility
