- Cargo ecosystem integration with automatic dependency management
- FFI function binding with unsafe block encapsulation
- Rust trait generation for Runa interface mapping
- Memory-safe struct binding with lifetime management
- Type conversion implementation with zero-cost abstractions
- Error handling integration with Rust Result types
- Ownership model mapping between Runa and Rust systems
- Generic and lifetime parameter support for flexible APIs
- Build system integration with build.rs and Cargo features
- Documentation generation with rustdoc compatibility
- Testing framework integration with Rust testing conventions
- Performance optimization for minimal overhead bindings
- Error handling approach for robust Rust interoperability
- Memory management considerations for Rust-Runa data safety
- Concurrency/threading considerations for Rust async compatibility
