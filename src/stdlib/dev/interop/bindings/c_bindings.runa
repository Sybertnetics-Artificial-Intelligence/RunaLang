C Language Binding Generation System

This module provides comprehensive C language binding generation capabilities for Runa interoperability, enabling seamless integration between Runa and C codebases.

Key features and capabilities:
- Automated C binding generation from Runa functions and types
- Standard-compliant C code generation (C89, C99, C11, C17, C23)
- Header file generation with proper include guards and declarations
- Source file generation with wrapper functions and type conversions
- Multiple calling convention support (cdecl, stdcall, fastcall)
- Static and dynamic library generation with build system integration
- Struct mapping with proper memory layout and alignment handling
- Opaque pointer support for complex Runa types
- Comprehensive error handling with C-compatible error codes
- Memory management integration with constructor/destructor patterns
- Namespace prefix support for avoiding symbol conflicts
- Build system integration with Makefile, CMake, and pkg-config
- Cross-platform compatibility with architecture-specific optimizations
- Documentation generation with C-style comments and API references
- Performance optimization for minimal call overhead
- Error handling approach for robust C interoperability
- Memory management considerations for C-Runa data safety
- Concurrency/threading considerations for thread-safe C bindings
