- Execution context management with sandbox and security controls
- Error handling and exception propagation across language boundaries
- Memory management with garbage collection configuration and monitoring
- Performance monitoring with execution timing and resource usage tracking
- Global variable access and manipulation from host environment
- Host function and type registration for Runa script access
- Runtime lifecycle management with suspend, resume, and cleanup operations
- Multi-threading support with thread-safe runtime operations
- JIT and AOTT compilation integration for high-performance execution
- Debugging support with stack trace and error reporting
- Configuration management for optimization levels and runtime behavior
