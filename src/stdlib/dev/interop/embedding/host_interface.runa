- Performance optimization with zero-copy data transfer where possible
- Host type binding with full method and property access
- Asynchronous operation support with callback-based completion
- Memory allocation coordination to prevent fragmentation
- Reference counting integration for shared ownership semantics
- Interface validation and compatibility checking
- Comprehensive statistics and monitoring for performance analysis
- Cross-platform compatibility with platform-specific optimizations
- Security boundary management for sandboxed execution
- Hot-swappable interface bindings for dynamic environments
- Documentation generation for host language API consumers
