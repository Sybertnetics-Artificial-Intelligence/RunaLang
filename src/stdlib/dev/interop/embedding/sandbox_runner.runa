- Execution timeout management with graceful and forced termination
- Output capture and filtering for stdout and stderr streams
- Security violation logging and detailed audit trails
- Snapshot and restore capabilities for execution state management
- Performance monitoring with CPU, memory, and I/O usage tracking
- Dynamic security policy updates during runtime
- Container-based isolation using modern containerization technologies
- Virtual machine isolation for maximum security in high-risk scenarios
- Capability-based security model with fine-grained permissions
- Resource usage analytics and optimization recommendations
- Multi-tenant execution with tenant isolation and resource allocation
- Debugging support with controlled access to sandbox internals
- Integration with system security frameworks and monitoring tools
- Compliance support for regulatory and security requirements
- Performance optimization with minimal overhead for trusted code
- Cross-platform compatibility with platform-specific security features
- Error handling approach for robust sandbox management
- Memory management considerations for isolated execution environments
