Callback Function Wrapping System for Bidirectional FFI Communication

This module provides comprehensive callback function wrapping capabilities for FFI interoperability, enabling bidirectional function calls between Runa and foreign languages.

Key features and capabilities:
- Bidirectional callback wrapping for Runa and foreign language functions
- Multiple calling convention support (cdecl, stdcall, fastcall, vectorcall)
- Automatic trampoline code generation for callback bridging
- Thread-safe callback invocation with proper synchronization
- Exception handling and error propagation across language boundaries
- Callback lifetime management with automatic cleanup and resource tracking
- Performance monitoring and statistics collection for callback operations
- Type marshaling integration for parameter and return value conversion
- Memory safety guarantees with proper ownership and cleanup management
- Error handling approach for robust callback operations
- Memory management considerations for cross-language callback safety
- Concurrency/threading considerations for thread-safe callback execution
