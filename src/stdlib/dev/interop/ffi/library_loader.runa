Dynamic Library Loading and Symbol Resolution System

This module provides comprehensive dynamic library loading and symbol resolution capabilities for FFI interoperability, enabling runtime access to foreign libraries and their exported symbols.

Key features and capabilities:
- Cross-platform dynamic library loading with unified API
- Intelligent library search with configurable search paths and environment variables
- Symbol resolution and caching for efficient function and variable access
- Dependency management with automatic dependency loading and resolution
- Library version management and compatibility validation
- Runtime symbol discovery and introspection capabilities
- Reference counting and automatic cleanup for loaded libraries
- Platform-specific optimizations for Windows (DLL), Linux (SO), and macOS (dylib)
- Security validation and sandboxing for untrusted libraries
- Error handling approach for robust library operations
- Memory management considerations for dynamic library safety
- Concurrency/threading considerations for thread-safe library operations
