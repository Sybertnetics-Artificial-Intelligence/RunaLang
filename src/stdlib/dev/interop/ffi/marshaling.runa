Data Marshaling and Serialization System for Cross-Language Communication

This module provides comprehensive data marshaling and serialization capabilities for FFI interoperability, enabling safe and efficient data exchange between Runa and foreign languages.

Key features and capabilities:
- Cross-language data marshaling with automatic serialization and deserialization
- Memory-safe data transfer with proper lifetime management and cleanup
- Support for primitive types, structures, arrays, pointers, and complex nested data
- Efficient buffer management with memory pooling and alignment handling
- Endianness conversion and platform-specific data layout adaptation
- String marshaling with multiple encoding support (UTF-8, UTF-16, ASCII)
- Pointer and reference marshaling with ownership tracking
- Validation and integrity checking for marshaled data
- Performance optimization with zero-copy operations where possible
- Error handling approach for robust marshaling operations
- Memory management considerations for cross-language data safety
- Concurrency/threading considerations for thread-safe marshaling operations
