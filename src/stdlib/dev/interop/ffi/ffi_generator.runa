This module provides comprehensive FFI binding generation capabilities for the Runa interoperability system, enabling automated creation of foreign function interface bindings.

Key features and capabilities:
- Automated FFI binding generation from C/C++ headers and library specifications
- Multi-language target support with customizable code generation templates
- Intelligent type mapping and conversion between Runa and foreign types
- Function wrapper generation with parameter marshaling and error handling
- Memory management integration for safe foreign memory access
- Calling convention support (cdecl, stdcall, fastcall, vectorcall)
- Cross-platform compatibility with architecture-specific optimizations
- Build system integration with automatic dependency management
- Comprehensive test suite generation for binding validation
- Error handling approach for robust FFI operations
- Memory management considerations for foreign memory safety
- Concurrency/threading considerations for thread-safe FFI operations
