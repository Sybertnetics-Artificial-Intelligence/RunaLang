- Configurable service behaviors and response patterns
- Integration with test orchestration and environment management
- Performance-optimized mock services with realistic latency simulation
- Support for various protocols and service types (HTTP, gRPC, database, etc.)
- State management and session handling for complex scenarios
- Thread-safe mock services for concurrent testing
- Integration with test data management and fixture systems
- Rich mock service diagnostics and interaction tracking
- Standards compliance with service mocking patterns
