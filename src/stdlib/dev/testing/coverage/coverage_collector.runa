Coverage Data Collection

This module provides comprehensive coverage data collection capabilities for
code coverage analysis, enabling systematic collection of execution data
during testing with support for multiple coverage types and instrumentation.

Key features and capabilities:
- Comprehensive coverage data collection during test execution
- Support for multiple coverage types (line, branch, function, condition)
- Real-time coverage tracking with minimal performance overhead
- Integration with test execution frameworks and runners
- Performance-optimized data collection with efficient storage
- Thread-safe coverage collection for parallel test execution
- Integration with coverage analysis and reporting systems
- Rich coverage data validation and quality assurance
- Standards compliance with coverage collection patterns
- Extensible collection framework for custom coverage metrics
- Coverage data persistence and serialization capabilities
- Instrumentation coordination and conflict resolution
