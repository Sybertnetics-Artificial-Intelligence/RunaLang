Test Registration System

This module provides comprehensive test registration and discovery capabilities
for managing test cases, test suites, and test metadata across the testing framework.

Key features and capabilities:
- Dynamic test registration and discovery mechanisms
- Test metadata indexing and querying capabilities
- Plugin-based test discovery for multiple frameworks
- Hierarchical test organization and categorization
- Test dependency tracking and resolution
- Automatic test case generation and registration
- Integration with IDE and development tools
- Test registry persistence and caching
- Support for distributed test discovery
- Real-time test registry updates and notifications
- Performance-optimized test lookup and filtering
- Standards compliance with multiple testing frameworks
- Integration with continuous integration systems
