Test Execution Engine

This module provides the core test execution engine for running individual tests,
test suites, and managing test lifecycle. It coordinates test discovery, execution,
and result collection across all testing scenarios.

Key features and capabilities:
- High-performance test execution with parallel processing
- Test lifecycle management (setup, execution, teardown)
- Test isolation and resource management
- Support for synchronous and asynchronous test execution
- Test timeout handling and resource cleanup
- Integration with assertion frameworks and mocking systems
- Real-time test progress reporting and monitoring
- Test result aggregation and summary generation
- Memory-efficient execution for large test suites
- Thread-safe test execution coordination
- Integration with debugging and profiling tools
- Support for test filtering and selective execution
- Error recovery and graceful test failure handling
- Performance optimization for test execution speed
- Standards compliance with xUnit testing patterns
