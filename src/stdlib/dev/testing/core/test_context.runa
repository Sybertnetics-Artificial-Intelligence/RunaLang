Test Execution Context

This module provides comprehensive test execution context management for maintaining
test isolation, shared state, and resource coordination across test executions.

Key features and capabilities:
- Test execution context isolation and management
- Shared resource coordination across test cases
- Test environment setup and teardown coordination
- Context-aware test data and fixture management
- Thread-safe context sharing for parallel execution
- Integration with dependency injection systems
- Context inheritance for nested test scenarios
- Resource cleanup and memory management
- Integration with mocking and stubbing frameworks
- Support for contextual test configuration
- Performance monitoring within test contexts
- Error propagation and context-aware debugging
- Standards compliance with xUnit context patterns
