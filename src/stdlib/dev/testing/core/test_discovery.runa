Automatic Test Discovery

This module provides intelligent test discovery capabilities for automatically
finding, categorizing, and organizing test cases across codebases and projects.

Key features and capabilities:
- Intelligent test discovery using multiple detection strategies
- Convention-based test identification and classification
- Annotation-driven test discovery and metadata extraction
- File system scanning with configurable patterns and filters
- Integration with multiple testing frameworks and conventions
- Parallel test discovery for large codebases
- Incremental discovery with change detection
- Plugin architecture for custom discovery strategies
- Test categorization and tagging based on discovery rules
- Performance-optimized discovery with caching mechanisms
- Integration with IDE and development tool discovery
- Support for distributed and remote test discovery
- Standards compliance across multiple testing frameworks
