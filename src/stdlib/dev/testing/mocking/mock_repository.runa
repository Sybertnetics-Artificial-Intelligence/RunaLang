Mock Object Management

This module provides comprehensive mock object management capabilities
including registration, lifecycle management, and centralized mock
coordination across test executions and scenarios.

Key features and capabilities:
- Centralized mock object registration and management
- Mock lifecycle coordination and cleanup
- Mock object discovery and lookup mechanisms
- Integration with test frameworks and dependency injection
- Performance-optimized mock registry and caching
- Support for mock sharing and reuse across tests
- Thread-safe mock management for parallel testing
- Mock object versioning and compatibility tracking
- Integration with mock builders and generators
- Rich mock metadata and configuration management
- Standards compliance with mock management patterns
- Comprehensive mock repository diagnostics and reporting
