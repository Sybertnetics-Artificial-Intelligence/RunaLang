Method Stub Generation

This module provides automated stub generation capabilities for creating
method stubs from interfaces, classes, and method signatures with intelligent
behavior inference and configuration assistance.

Key features and capabilities:
- Automated stub generation from interfaces and type definitions
- Intelligent behavior inference and default response generation
- Integration with code analysis and reflection capabilities
- Performance-optimized stub generation and compilation
- Support for complex type hierarchies and generic types
- Stub template generation and customization
- Thread-safe stub generation for parallel processing
- Integration with testing frameworks and mock systems
- Code generation with proper formatting and documentation
- Stub validation and compatibility checking
- Standards compliance with code generation patterns
- Rich stub metadata and configuration support
