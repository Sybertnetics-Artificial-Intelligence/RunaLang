Call Expectation Verification

This module provides comprehensive call expectation verification capabilities
for validating mock object behavior, call patterns, and interaction
sequences with sophisticated matching and reporting features.

Key features and capabilities:
- Comprehensive mock interaction expectation and verification
- Flexible parameter matching with custom matchers
- Call sequence and timing verification capabilities
- Integration with assertion frameworks and test runners
- Performance-optimized verification execution
- Support for complex interaction patterns and scenarios
- Thread-safe verification operations for parallel testing
- Rich verification failure diagnostics and reporting
- Integration with mock frameworks and test doubles
- Verification rule composition and chaining
- Standards compliance with verification patterns
- Advanced interaction analysis and pattern detection
