Test Spy Implementation

This module provides comprehensive test spy capabilities for monitoring
and recording interactions with real objects while preserving their
original behavior and functionality.

Key features and capabilities:
- Test spy creation and configuration with behavior preservation
- Method call interception and recording capabilities
- Real object behavior preservation with monitoring overlay
- Integration with test frameworks and assertion libraries
- Performance-optimized spy execution and monitoring
- Support for selective method spying and filtering
- Thread-safe spy operations for parallel testing
- Spy lifecycle management and cleanup
- Integration with verification and analysis systems
- Rich spy interaction recording and analysis
- Standards compliance with test spy patterns
- Comprehensive spy diagnostics and reporting
