Mock Object Creation

This module provides comprehensive mock object creation capabilities with
builder patterns, configuration management, and dynamic behavior specification
for flexible and powerful mock-based testing scenarios.

Key features and capabilities:
- Mock object creation with builder pattern support
- Dynamic behavior specification and configuration
- Method call interception and response configuration
- Integration with test frameworks and assertion libraries
- Performance-optimized mock object instantiation
- Support for partial mocks and spy objects
- Thread-safe mock creation for parallel testing
- Mock object lifecycle management and cleanup
- Integration with dependency injection systems
- Rich mock behavior specification and validation
- Standards compliance with mock object patterns
- Comprehensive mock creation diagnostics and debugging
