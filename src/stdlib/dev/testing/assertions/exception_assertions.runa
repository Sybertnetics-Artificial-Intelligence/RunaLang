Exception Testing

This module provides specialized assertion capabilities for testing
exception behavior, error conditions, and exceptional program flow
with comprehensive validation and diagnostic reporting.

Key features and capabilities:
- Exception throwing and catching assertion validation
- Exception type and message verification capabilities
- Exception cause chain analysis and validation
- Performance-optimized exception assertion execution
- Integration with error handling and debugging frameworks
- Support for complex exception scenario testing
- Exception assertion failure diagnostics and reporting
- Thread-safe exception assertion execution
- Integration with test frameworks and error testing
- Standards compliance with exception testing patterns
- Rich exception context analysis and insights
- Custom exception validation and extension support

Note: =====================================================================

Process called "assert_throws" that takes operation as Function[Nothing, String], expected_exception_type as String returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that operation throws exception of specified type
    Note: Executes operation and validates exception type
    Note: Provides detailed exception analysis and context
    Note: Returns assertion result with exception validation
    Note: TODO: Implement exception throwing assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Exception throwing assertion not yet implemented"

Process called "assert_does_not_throw" that takes operation as Function[Nothing, String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that operation completes without throwing exception
    Note: Executes operation and validates clean completion
    Note: Provides details of unexpected exceptions if they occur
    Note: Returns assertion result with no-exception validation
    Note: TODO: Implement no exception assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "No exception assertion not yet implemented"

Process called "assert_throws_with_message" that takes operation as Function[Nothing, String], expected_exception_type as String, expected_message as String returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that operation throws exception with specific message
    Note: Validates both exception type and message content
    Note: Supports exact match and pattern matching for messages
    Note: Returns assertion result with message validation
    Note: TODO: Implement exception with message assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Exception with message assertion not yet implemented"
