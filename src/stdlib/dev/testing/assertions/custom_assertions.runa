Custom Assertion Framework

This module provides capabilities for creating, registering, and executing
custom assertion functions tailored to specific testing needs and domain
requirements.

Key features and capabilities:
- Custom assertion definition and registration system
- Type-safe custom assertion builders with validation
- Integration with basic assertion framework
- Support for complex domain-specific assertions
- Assertion composition and chaining capabilities
- Performance-optimized custom assertion execution
- Integration with test discovery and reporting
- Custom assertion metadata and documentation
- Assertion parameter validation and type checking
- Reusable assertion libraries and sharing
- Integration with IDE tooling and code completion
- Standards compliance with extensible assertion patterns

Process called "create_assertion_builder" that takes assertion_name as String, description as String returns AssertionBuilder:
    Note: Create new assertion builder for custom assertion definition
    Note: Initializes builder with name and description validation
    Note: Sets up parameter definition and validation framework
    Note: Returns configured builder ready for assertion construction
    Note: TODO: Implement assertion builder creation
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Assertion builder creation not yet implemented"

Process called "build_custom_assertion" that takes builder as AssertionBuilder returns CustomAssertion:
    Note: Build custom assertion from completed builder configuration
    Note: Validates all required components are specified
    Note: Generates assertion metadata and documentation
    Note: Returns complete custom assertion ready for registration
    Note: TODO: Implement custom assertion building
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Custom assertion building not yet implemented"

Process called "register_custom_assertion" that takes assertion as CustomAssertion returns Boolean:
    Note: Register custom assertion for use in tests
    Note: Validates assertion uniqueness and compatibility
    Note: Integrates assertion with test execution framework
    Note: Returns success status of assertion registration
    Note: TODO: Implement assertion registration
