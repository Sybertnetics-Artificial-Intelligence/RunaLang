Numeric Comparison Assertions

This module provides specialized assertion capabilities for numeric comparisons,
range validation, mathematical operations, and precision-aware numeric testing
with comprehensive diagnostic information.

Key features and capabilities:
- Numeric comparison assertions (greater than, less than, equal)
- Range validation and boundary testing
- Floating-point precision and tolerance handling
- Mathematical operation result validation
- Statistical and distribution testing
- Performance-optimized numeric comparison algorithms
- Integration with mathematical libraries and utilities
- Support for various numeric types and representations
- Thread-safe numeric assertion execution
- Integration with test frameworks and mathematical testing
- Standards compliance with numeric testing patterns
- Rich numeric failure diagnostics with precision details

Process called "assert_greater_than" that takes actual as Float, expected as Float, message as Optional[String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that actual value is greater than expected value
    Note: Provides numeric comparison with precision handling
    Note: Includes actual vs expected values in failure diagnostics
    Note: Returns assertion result with comparison details
    Note: TODO: Implement greater than assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Greater than assertion not yet implemented"

Process called "assert_less_than" that takes actual as Float, expected as Float, message as Optional[String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that actual value is less than expected value
    Note: Provides numeric comparison with precision handling
    Note: Includes comparison context in failure diagnostics
    Note: Returns assertion result with validation details
    Note: TODO: Implement less than assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Less than assertion not yet implemented"

Process called "assert_approximately_equals" that takes actual as Float, expected as Float, tolerance as Float, message as Optional[String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that actual value approximately equals expected within tolerance
    Note: Handles floating-point precision issues gracefully
    Note: Provides tolerance-based comparison with detailed diagnostics
    Note: Returns assertion result with precision analysis
    Note: TODO: Implement approximate equality assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Approximate equality assertion not yet implemented"
