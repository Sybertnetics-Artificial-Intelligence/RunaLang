Collection-Specific Assertions

This module provides specialized assertion capabilities for validating
collection properties, membership, ordering, and other collection-specific
behaviors with comprehensive diagnostic reporting.

Key features and capabilities:
- Collection membership and containment assertions
- Collection size and length validation
- Collection ordering and sorting assertions
- Set operations and subset validation
- Collection equality with flexible comparison strategies
- Performance-optimized collection comparison algorithms
- Integration with custom collection types
- Deep collection comparison with nested validation
- Thread-safe collection assertion execution
- Integration with test frameworks and reporting
- Standards compliance with collection testing patterns
- Rich collection failure diagnostics and visualization

Process called "assert_contains" that takes collection as List[String], item as String, message as Optional[String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that collection contains specified item
    Note: Performs membership testing with type-appropriate comparison
    Note: Provides collection contents in failure diagnostics
    Note: Returns assertion result with containment validation
    Note: TODO: Implement collection containment assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Collection containment assertion not yet implemented"

Process called "assert_not_contains" that takes collection as List[String], item as String, message as Optional[String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that collection does not contain specified item
    Note: Validates absence of item in collection
    Note: Provides collection summary in failure context
    Note: Returns assertion result with absence validation
    Note: TODO: Implement collection non-containment assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Collection non-containment assertion not yet implemented"

Process called "assert_empty" that takes collection as List[String], message as Optional[String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that collection is empty
    Note: Validates collection has no elements
    Note: Provides collection size and contents in failure diagnostics
    Note: Returns assertion result with emptiness validation
    Note: TODO: Implement empty collection assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Empty collection assertion not yet implemented"
