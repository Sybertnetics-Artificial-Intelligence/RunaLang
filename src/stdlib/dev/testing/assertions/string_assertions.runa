String-Specific Assertions

This module provides specialized assertion capabilities for string validation,
pattern matching, content analysis, and text-based testing scenarios with
comprehensive diagnostic and analysis features.

Key features and capabilities:
- String content and pattern matching assertions
- String length and structure validation
- Unicode and encoding-aware string comparison
- Regular expression and pattern matching
- String similarity and distance calculations
- Performance-optimized string comparison algorithms
- Integration with text processing and analysis tools
- Support for various string encodings and formats
- Thread-safe string assertion execution
- Integration with test frameworks and text validation
- Standards compliance with string testing patterns
- Rich string failure diagnostics with content visualization

    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "String containment assertion not yet implemented"

Process called "assert_string_starts_with" that takes text as String, prefix as String, message as Optional[String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that string starts with specified prefix
    Note: Validates string beginning matches expected prefix
