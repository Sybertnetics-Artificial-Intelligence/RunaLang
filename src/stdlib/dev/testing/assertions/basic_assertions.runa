Basic Test Assertions

This module provides fundamental test assertion capabilities for validating
test conditions, comparing values, and reporting assertion failures with
detailed diagnostic information.

Key features and capabilities:
- Core assertion primitives (assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse)
- Type-safe assertion methods with comprehensive error reporting
- Custom assertion failure messages and diagnostic context
- Assertion chaining and compound assertion support
- Performance-optimized assertion evaluation
- Integration with test runners and reporting systems
- Support for deep object comparison and validation
- Assertion statistics and failure analysis
- Thread-safe assertion execution for parallel tests
- Integration with mocking and stubbing frameworks
- Standards compliance with xUnit assertion patterns
- Rich assertion failure diagnostics with context

Process called "assert_equals" that takes actual as String, expected as String, message as Optional[String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that two values are equal with detailed comparison
    Note: Performs deep equality checking for complex types
    Note: Provides detailed failure diagnostics when assertion fails
    Note: Returns comprehensive assertion result with context
    Note: TODO: Implement equality assertion with deep comparison
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Equality assertion not yet implemented"

Process called "assert_true" that takes value as Boolean, message as Optional[String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that boolean value is true
    Note: Provides clear failure message for false values
    Note: Supports custom failure messages for better diagnostics
    Note: Returns assertion result with boolean validation
    Note: TODO: Implement boolean true assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Boolean true assertion not yet implemented"

Process called "assert_false" that takes value as Boolean, message as Optional[String] returns AssertionResult:
    Note: Assert that boolean value is false
    Note: Provides clear failure message for true values
    Note: Supports custom failure messages for context
    Note: Returns assertion result with boolean validation
    Note: TODO: Implement boolean false assertion
    Throw Errors.NotImplemented with "Boolean false assertion not yet implemented"
