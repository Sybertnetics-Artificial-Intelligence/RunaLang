Value Shrinking for Minimal Cases

This module provides comprehensive value shrinking capabilities for
property-based testing, enabling minimal counterexample discovery through
systematic value reduction and test case minimization.

Key features and capabilities:
- Comprehensive shrinking algorithms for primitive and composite types
- Systematic value reduction strategies with convergence guarantees
- Integration with property testing frameworks and failure analysis
- Performance-optimized shrinking with early termination conditions
- Custom shrinking strategies for user-defined types
- Shrinking history tracking and replay capabilities
- Thread-safe shrinking operations for parallel testing
- Integration with generator and property runner systems
- Rich shrinking diagnostics and progress monitoring
- Standards compliance with property testing shrinking patterns
- Shrinking validation and correctness verification
- Extensible shrinking framework for custom reduction strategies
