Setup/Teardown Hooks

This module provides comprehensive setup and teardown hook management
for test lifecycle coordination, resource management, and cleanup
operations with flexible execution strategies and error handling.

Key features and capabilities:
- Flexible setup and teardown hook registration and execution
- Multiple hook execution strategies (sequential, parallel, conditional)
- Resource management and cleanup coordination
- Integration with test frameworks and lifecycle management
- Performance-optimized hook execution and coordination
- Support for nested and hierarchical hook structures
- Thread-safe hook execution for parallel testing
- Error handling and recovery for hook failures
- Integration with fixture and resource management systems
- Rich hook execution diagnostics and monitoring
- Standards compliance with test lifecycle patterns
- Comprehensive hook failure analysis and reporting
