Fixture Data Loading

This module provides comprehensive fixture data loading capabilities for
loading test data from various sources including files, databases, and
external services with caching and performance optimization.

Key features and capabilities:
- Multi-source fixture data loading (files, databases, APIs)
- Flexible data format support (JSON, YAML, CSV, XML)
- Performance-optimized loading with caching mechanisms
- Integration with external data sources and services
- Data validation and integrity checking during load
- Lazy loading and on-demand fixture data retrieval
- Thread-safe fixture loading for parallel testing
- Integration with fixture management systems
- Data transformation and normalization during load
- Error handling and recovery for loading failures
- Standards compliance with data loading patterns
- Rich loading diagnostics and performance metrics
