Database Test Fixtures

This module provides comprehensive database test fixture capabilities for
managing test database setup, data seeding, transaction handling, and
cleanup operations with support for multiple database systems.

Key features and capabilities:
- Database fixture setup and teardown with transaction management
- Multi-database system support with unified interface
- Test data seeding and cleanup with referential integrity
- Database schema management and migration support
- Performance-optimized database operations and connection pooling
- Integration with database testing frameworks and tools
- Thread-safe database operations for parallel testing
- Database state isolation and snapshot capabilities
- Integration with fixture and lifecycle management systems
- Rich database operation diagnostics and monitoring
- Standards compliance with database testing patterns
- Comprehensive database fixture failure analysis and recovery
