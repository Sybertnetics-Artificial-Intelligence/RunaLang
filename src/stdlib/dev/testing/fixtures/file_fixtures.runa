File System Fixtures

This module provides comprehensive file system test fixture capabilities for
managing test files, directories, and file system state with cleanup,
isolation, and cross-platform compatibility support.

Key features and capabilities:
- File system fixture creation and management with isolation
- Temporary file and directory management with automatic cleanup
- File content generation and template-based file creation
- Cross-platform file system operation support
- Performance-optimized file operations and batch processing
- Integration with test frameworks and lifecycle management
- Thread-safe file operations for parallel testing
- File system state snapshot and restoration capabilities
- Integration with fixture and resource management systems
- Rich file operation diagnostics and monitoring
- Standards compliance with file system testing patterns
- Comprehensive file fixture error handling and recovery
