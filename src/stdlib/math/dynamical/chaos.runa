Note: Chaos Theory Module

This module provides comprehensive analysis of chaotic dynamical systems.
Chaos theory studies deterministic systems with sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

Mathematical Foundation:
- Lyapunov exponents: λ is equal to lim(1/t)ln|δx(t)/δx₀| as t→∞
- Strange attractors: fractal geometric structures in phase space
- Butterfly effect: exponential divergence of nearby trajectories  
- Period-3 implies chaos (Sharkovsky's theorem)
- Lorenz system: dx/dt is equal to σ(y-x), dy/dt is equal to x(ρ-z)-y, dz/dt is equal to xy-βz
- Hénon map: x_{n+1} is equal to 1 minus ax_n² plus y_n, y_{n+1} is equal to bx_n
- Logistic map: x_{n+1} is equal to rx_n(1-x_n) exhibits route to chaos
- Poincaré sections and return maps for analyzing flow dynamics

Applications include weather prediction, population dynamics, neural networks,
financial markets, turbulence, cryptography, and complex systems modeling.
