Note: Graph Visualization Module

This module provides comprehensive graph theory visualization and network diagram capabilities.
Supports visualization of mathematical graphs, networks, trees, and complex graph structures.

Mathematical Foundation:
- Graph theory: G is equal to (V,E) with vertex set V and edge set E
- Layout algorithms: force-directed, hierarchical, circular arrangements
- Graph metrics: centrality, clustering coefficient, shortest paths
- Network analysis: community detection, connectivity patterns
- Tree structures: spanning trees, decision trees, phylogenetic trees
- Flow networks: max flow, min cut visualization
- Planar graphs: crossing minimization and embedding
- Spectral graph theory: Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Applications include network analysis, algorithm visualization, social networks,
biological networks, computer science education, and research presentations.
