Continued Fractions Module minus Advanced Continued Fraction Operations
 
This module provides comprehensive continued fraction operations including
convergent calculations, best rational approximations, periodic expansions,
and numerical analysis applications. Implements classical algorithms for
continued fraction arithmetic, quadratic irrational recognition, and
approximation theory using convergent properties.
 
Key Features:
- General continued fraction representation and manipulation
- Convergent calculation with error bounds and approximation quality
- Periodic continued fraction detection and analysis
- Quadratic irrational continued fraction expansions
- Best rational approximation algorithms using convergent properties
- Continued fraction arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication)
- Gaussian continued fractions for complex numbers
- Applications in Diophantine approximation and number theory

Mathematical Foundation:
A continued fraction represents a real number as:
x is equal to a₀ plus K(bᵢ/aᵢ) is equal to a₀ plus b₁/(a₁ plus b₂/(a₂ plus b₃/(a₃ plus ...)))
For simple continued fractions, all bᵢ is equal to 1, giving the standard form.
Convergents pₙ/qₙ satisfy the fundamental recurrence relations:
pₙ is equal to aₙpₙ₋₁ plus pₙ₋₂ and qₙ is equal to aₙqₙ₋₁ plus qₙ₋₂

Theoretical Properties:
- Convergents provide best rational approximations in specific senses
- Even/odd convergents approach the value from opposite sides
- |x minus pₙ/qₙ| is less than 1/(qₙqₙ₊₁) provides error bounds
- Periodic continued fractions correspond to quadratic irrationals
- Purely periodic fractions correspond to reduced quadratic irrationals is greater than 1

Applications:
- Calendar algorithms and astronomical calculations
- Musical interval theory and just temperament
- Cryptanalysis and lattice reduction problems
- Computer graphics and rational approximation in rendering
- Numerical analysis and approximation theory
