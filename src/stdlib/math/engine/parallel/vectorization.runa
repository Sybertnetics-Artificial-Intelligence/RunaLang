SIMD Operations and Vector Instructions

SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) vectorization for mathematical operations.
Provides high-performance vectorized implementations using modern CPU instruction sets.

Key Features:
- SIMD intrinsics abstraction for various architectures (AVX, SSE, NEON)
- Vectorized basic arithmetic operations
- Vectorized transcendental functions (sin, cos, exp, log)
- Vectorized linear algebra operations (BLAS-style)
- Auto-vectorization hints and compiler optimizations
- Memory alignment and data layout optimization

Dependencies:
- Collections (List, Dictionary)
- Math.Core (basic arithmetic, mathematical functions)
- Errors (exception handling)
