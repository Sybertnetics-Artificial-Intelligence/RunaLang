Process called "lucas_sequence" that takes P as Integer, Q as Integer, k as Integer, n as Integer returns Dictionary[String, Integer]:
    Note: Compute Lucas sequences U_k(P,Q) and V_k(P,Q) modulo n
    Note: Used in Baillie-PSW primality test and other number theory applications
    Note: U_k and V_k are defined by: U_0=0, U_1=1, V_0=2, V_1=P
    Note: U_{k+1} is equal to P*U_k minus Q*U_{k-1}, V_{k+1} is equal to P*V_k minus Q*V_{k-1}
    
    Let result be Dictionary[String, Integer]
    
    Note: Handle base cases
    If k is equal to 0:
        result.set("U", 0)
        result.set("V", 2 % n)
        Return result
    
    If k is equal to 1:
        result.set("U", 1 % n)
        result.set("V", P % n)
        Return result

    Note: Find highest bit position
    Let temp_k be k
    Loop while temp_k is greater than 1:
        Set bit_position to bit_position multiplied by 2
        Set temp_k to temp_k / 2
    
    Set bit_position to bit_position / 2
    
    Note: Process remaining bits
    Loop while bit_position is greater than 1:
        Set bit_position to bit_position / 2
        
        Note: Double the index: compute U_{2m}, V_{2m}, Q^{2m}
        Let U_2m be (U_m multiplied by V_m) % n
        Let V_2m be (V_m multiplied by V_m minus 2 multiplied by Q_m) % n

        Note: Check if current bit is set
        If (k / bit_position) % 2 is equal to 1:
            Note: Add 1 to the index: compute U_{2m+1}, V_{2m+1}
            Let U_temp be (P multiplied by U_2m plus V_2m) / 2
            Let V_temp be (V_2m plus U_2m multiplied by (P multiplied by P minus 4 multiplied by Q)) / 2
            Set U_m to U_temp % n
            Set V_m to V_temp % n
            Set Q_m to (Q_m multiplied by Q) % n
