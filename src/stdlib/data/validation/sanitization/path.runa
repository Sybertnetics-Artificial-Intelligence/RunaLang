Path Traversal Prevention Operations

This module provides comprehensive path traversal prevention capabilities including
path normalization, jail enforcement, safe file operations, directory traversal
detection, symbolic link validation, and secure file system access controls
for preventing unauthorized file system access and manipulation.

Security Implications:
- Prevents directory traversal attacks through path normalization and validation
- Mitigates unauthorized file access through jail environment enforcement  
- Protects against symbolic link attacks and race condition exploits
- Ensures safe file system operations within defined security boundaries
- Guards against path manipulation through encoding and obfuscation techniques
- Prevents privilege escalation through secure file permission handling

Common Attack Vectors:
- Directory traversal using "../" sequences for path escape
- Absolute path injection to access system files outside application scope
- Symbolic link attacks to redirect file operations to unauthorized locations
- Unicode path encoding to bypass simple string-based validation
- Double encoding attacks using URL encoding variations
- Path separator manipulation across different operating systems
- Race condition attacks on file system operations
- Zip slip vulnerabilities in archive extraction operations
