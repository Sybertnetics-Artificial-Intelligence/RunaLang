Character Encoding Sanitization Operations

This module provides comprehensive character encoding sanitization capabilities including
UTF-8 validation, ASCII normalization, Base64 handling, URL encoding sanitization,
HTML entity processing, JSON escaping, and CSV sanitization for secure data
processing and cross-system compatibility.

Security Implications:
- Prevents encoding-based injection attacks through proper character validation
- Mitigates encoding confusion vulnerabilities in multi-layer applications
- Protects against overlong UTF-8 sequences and malformed character data
- Ensures safe data transmission across different encoding schemes
- Guards against encoding bypass attempts in security filters
- Prevents data corruption and interpretation errors in encoding conversions

Common Attack Vectors:
- Overlong UTF-8 encoding to bypass input validation filters
- Double encoding attacks using multiple encoding layers
- Character encoding confusion between different system components
- Base64 padding manipulation for payload obfuscation
- URL encoding bypass attempts using alternative encoding schemes
- HTML entity encoding for XSS payload delivery
- CSV injection through formula injection in encoded data
- JSON encoding manipulation for structure-based attacks
