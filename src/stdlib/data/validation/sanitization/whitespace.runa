Whitespace Normalization Operations

This module provides comprehensive whitespace normalization capabilities including
whitespace trimming, collapse operations, line ending standardization, tab-to-space
conversion, formatting preservation, and consistent whitespace handling for data
processing, text normalization, and secure input sanitization.

Security Implications:
- Prevents whitespace-based bypass attacks in input validation systems
- Mitigates format string vulnerabilities through consistent whitespace handling
- Protects against injection attacks using whitespace obfuscation techniques
- Ensures consistent data processing across different system components
- Guards against whitespace manipulation in security-sensitive comparisons
- Prevents parser confusion through normalized whitespace structures

Common Attack Vectors:
- Whitespace padding to bypass length-based validation checks
- Mixed whitespace types to confuse parsing and validation logic
- Invisible Unicode whitespace characters for steganographic payloads
- Line ending manipulation to break multi-line validation patterns
- Tab-space mixing to create inconsistent indentation-based parsing
- Zero-width space insertion for content hiding and bypass attempts
- Whitespace injection in structured data formats (JSON, XML, CSV)
- Format preservation attacks using non-standard whitespace sequences
