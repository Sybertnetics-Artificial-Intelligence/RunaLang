Unicode Normalization Operations

This module provides comprehensive Unicode normalization capabilities including
Unicode Normal Forms (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD), homoglyph detection, character
validation, bidirectional text handling, script mixing detection, and secure
Unicode processing for internationalization and security applications.

Security Implications:
- Prevents Unicode normalization attacks through consistent character representation
- Mitigates homoglyph spoofing attacks using visually similar Unicode characters
- Protects against bidirectional text override attacks and display manipulation
- Ensures safe processing of mixed-script content preventing confusion attacks
- Guards against Unicode steganography and hidden character injection
- Prevents normalization bypass attempts in security-sensitive comparisons

Common Attack Vectors:
- Homoglyph attacks using visually similar characters for domain spoofing
- Bidirectional text override for content manipulation and phishing
- Unicode steganography using invisible or zero-width characters
- Normalization bypass using decomposed vs composed character forms
- Script mixing attacks combining different writing system characters
- Confusable character substitution in security-critical identifiers
- Unicode buffer overflow through normalization expansion
- Encoding layer confusion between different Unicode representations
