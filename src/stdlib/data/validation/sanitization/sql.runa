SQL Injection Prevention Operations

This module provides comprehensive SQL injection prevention capabilities including
parameterized query handling, SQL escape sequence management, query validation,
safe query building, stored procedure validation, and dynamic query analysis
for secure database interaction and query processing.

Security Implications:
- Prevents SQL injection attacks through proper query parameterization
- Mitigates database compromise through input sanitization and validation
- Protects against blind SQL injection through query structure analysis
- Ensures safe dynamic query construction and execution
- Guards against second-order SQL injection through persistent data validation
- Prevents stored procedure abuse through parameter validation

Common Attack Vectors:
- Union-based SQL injection for data extraction
- Boolean-based blind SQL injection for information disclosure
- Time-based blind SQL injection for database inference
- Error-based SQL injection through database error messages
- Second-order SQL injection through stored malicious data
- NoSQL injection in document-based database queries
- Stored procedure injection through parameter manipulation
- Query structure manipulation through comment injection
