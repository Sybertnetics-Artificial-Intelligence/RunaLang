HTML Sanitization and XSS Prevention Operations

This module provides comprehensive HTML sanitization capabilities including
XSS prevention, tag whitelisting, attribute filtering, content extraction,
safe HTML rendering, DOM sanitization, and CSS sanitization for secure
web application development and content processing.

Security Implications:
- Prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks through proper HTML sanitization
- Mitigates DOM-based vulnerabilities through safe parsing and rendering
- Protects against HTML injection attacks and malicious content embedding
- Ensures safe handling of user-generated HTML content and rich text input
- Guards against CSS-based attacks through style attribute sanitization
- Prevents JavaScript execution in HTML content through script tag removal

Common Attack Vectors:
- Reflected XSS through unescaped HTML output
- Stored XSS through persistent malicious HTML content
- DOM XSS through unsafe innerHTML assignments
- CSS injection through style attributes
- Event handler injection through onclick, onload attributes
- SVG-based XSS through embedded scripts in scalable vector graphics
- Data URI schemes for payload delivery
- HTML entity encoding bypass attempts
