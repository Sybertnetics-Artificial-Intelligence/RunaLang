Permission-Based Validation Module

Provides comprehensive permission checking and access control validation capabilities.
Supports RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), ACL (Access Control Lists), and capability-based security.
Features include hierarchical permissions, permission inheritance, context-aware access control, and delegation.
Designed for enterprise-grade security validation with flexible permission models.
Supports dynamic permission evaluation, audit trails, and compliance reporting.
