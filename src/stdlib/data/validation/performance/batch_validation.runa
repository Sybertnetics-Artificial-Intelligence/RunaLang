Batch Validation Operations System

This module provides comprehensive batch validation capabilities including
bulk validation operations, parallel processing, batch optimization, work
partitioning, result aggregation, and error collection for high-throughput
validation scenarios with optimal resource utilization.

Performance benefits:
- O(n/p) parallel execution vs O(n) serial processing
- Reduces per-item overhead through batching
- Optimizes resource utilization with work partitioning
- Enables efficient error collection and reporting
- Supports dynamic load balancing across processing units
