Validation Optimization Techniques System

This module provides comprehensive validation optimization techniques including
short-circuiting, memoization, JIT compilation, hot path optimization,
algorithmic improvements, and performance profiling for maximum validation
efficiency and minimal computational overhead.

Performance benefits:
- O(1) short-circuit evaluation vs O(n) full validation
- O(1) memoized lookups vs O(f(n)) recomputation
- JIT compilation reduces interpretation overhead by 10-100x
- Hot path optimization focuses resources on critical validations
- Algorithmic improvements reduce complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)
