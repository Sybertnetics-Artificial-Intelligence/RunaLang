Streaming Validation System

This module provides comprehensive streaming validation capabilities including
streaming validation for large datasets, chunked processing, backpressure handling,
flow control, streaming aggregation, and real-time validation for continuous
data processing with optimal memory usage and throughput.

Performance benefits:
- O(1) memory usage regardless of dataset size
- Enables real-time validation with minimal latency
- Supports backpressure handling for flow control
- Provides streaming aggregation with windowing
- Optimizes throughput with pipeline parallelism
