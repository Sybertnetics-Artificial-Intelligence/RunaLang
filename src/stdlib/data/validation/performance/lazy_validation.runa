Lazy Validation Strategies System

This module provides comprehensive lazy validation capabilities including
deferred validation, on-demand checking, progressive validation, conditional
evaluation, lazy iterators, and validation pipelines for optimal performance
and resource utilization in large-scale validation scenarios.

Performance benefits:
- O(1) initialization vs O(n) eager validation
- Reduces unnecessary computational overhead
- Enables just-in-time validation for better resource usage
- Supports progressive disclosure of validation results
- Memory-efficient validation for large datasets
