Validation Result Caching System

This module provides comprehensive validation result caching capabilities including
TTL-based caching, cache invalidation strategies, cache warming, distributed caching,
cache statistics, and memory management for high-performance validation operations.

Performance benefits:
- O(1) cache hit retrieval vs O(n) re-validation
- Reduces computational overhead for repeated validations
- Minimizes database/network round trips for complex rules
- Supports cache warming for predictable validation patterns
- Distributed caching for horizontal scaling scenarios
