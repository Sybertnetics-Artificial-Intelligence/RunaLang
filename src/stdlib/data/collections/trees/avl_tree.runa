AVL Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree Operations

This module provides comprehensive AVL tree implementation including
self-balancing operations, rotations, height management, and all
standard binary search tree operations with guaranteed O(log n) performance.

Performance Characteristics:
- Search: O(log n) guaranteed
- Insert: O(log n) guaranteed  
- Delete: O(log n) guaranteed
- Rotations: O(1) per rotation
- Height: O(log n) guaranteed
- Space: O(n) for storage
