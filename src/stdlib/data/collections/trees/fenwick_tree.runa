Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) for Cumulative Frequency Queries

This module provides comprehensive Fenwick Tree implementation for efficient
prefix sum queries and point updates with minimal memory usage and simple
implementation compared to segment trees for cumulative operations.

Performance Characteristics:
- Build: O(n) time
- Prefix Sum: O(log n) time
- Point Update: O(log n) time
- Range Sum: O(log n) time (2 prefix operations)
- Space: O(n) exact space usage
- Implementation: Simple bit manipulation operations
