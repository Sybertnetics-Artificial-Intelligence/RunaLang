Binary Tree Data Structure Operations

This module provides comprehensive binary tree data structure implementation
including node operations, tree traversals, insertions, deletions, searches,
and tree manipulation operations for general-purpose binary tree usage.

Performance Characteristics:
- Search: O(n) worst case, O(log n) average case for balanced trees
- Insert: O(n) worst case, O(log n) average case for balanced trees
- Delete: O(n) worst case, O(log n) average case for balanced trees
- Traversal: O(n) for all nodes
- Space: O(n) for storage, O(h) for recursion where h is height
