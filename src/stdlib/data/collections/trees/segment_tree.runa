Segment Tree for Efficient Range Query Operations

This module provides comprehensive segment tree implementation for efficient
range queries and updates including range sum, min/max, range updates,
lazy propagation, and advanced segment tree variants for competitive programming.

Performance Characteristics:
- Build: O(n) time and space
- Range Query: O(log n) time
- Point Update: O(log n) time  
- Range Update: O(log n) time with lazy propagation
- Space: O(4n) in worst case, O(2n) typical
- Memory Access: Cache-friendly linear array storage
