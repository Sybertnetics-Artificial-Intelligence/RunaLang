B-Tree Multi-way Search Tree for Database Systems

This module provides comprehensive B-tree implementation optimized for
database systems and file storage with configurable node size, disk-friendly
operations, bulk loading, and range queries for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Performance Characteristics:
- Search: O(log n) with base t (branching factor)
- Insert: O(log n) with potential node splits
- Delete: O(log n) with potential node merges  
- Range Query: O(log n + k) where k is result size
- Disk I/O: Minimized through large node sizes
- Space: O(n) with high space utilization
