Quad Tree for 2D Spatial Indexing and Range Queries

This module provides comprehensive quad tree implementation for efficient
2D spatial indexing, point location, range queries, nearest neighbor search,
and collision detection in computational geometry and game development.

Performance Characteristics:
- Insert: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
- Search: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case  
- Range Query: O(log n + k) where k is result size
- Delete: O(log n) average
- Nearest Neighbor: O(log n) average
- Space: O(n) for points, O(4^h) worst case where h is height
