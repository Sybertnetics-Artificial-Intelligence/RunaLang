Suffix Tree for Advanced String Processing Operations

This module provides comprehensive suffix tree implementation for efficient
string matching, pattern searching, longest common substring finding,
and advanced string algorithms with linear time construction and queries.

Performance Characteristics:
- Construction: O(n) time using Ukkonen's algorithm
- Pattern Search: O(m) where m is pattern length
- Substring Search: O(m + occ) where occ is number of occurrences
- Longest Common Substring: O(n) time
- Space: O(n) linear space complexity
- Alphabet: Supports arbitrary character sets
