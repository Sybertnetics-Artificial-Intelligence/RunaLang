Red-Black Tree Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree Operations

This module provides comprehensive red-black tree implementation including
color-based balancing operations, rotations, insertion/deletion with recoloring,
and all standard binary search tree operations with guaranteed O(log n) performance.

Performance Characteristics:
- Search: O(log n) guaranteed
- Insert: O(log n) guaranteed with at most 2 rotations
- Delete: O(log n) guaranteed with at most 3 rotations
- Color operations: O(1) per operation
- Height: At most 2*log(n+1) guaranteed
- Space: O(n) for storage
