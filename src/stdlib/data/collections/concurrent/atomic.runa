Note: Atomic Collection Operations Module
Note: 
Note: This module provides atomic operations for collections that guarantee
Note: thread-safe access without locks. All operations are guaranteed to be
Note: atomic and provide memory ordering guarantees for concurrent access.
Note:
Note: Thread Safety: All operations are lock-free and wait-free
Note: Performance: O(1) for most operations with memory ordering overhead
Note: Memory Model: Follows sequential consistency by default
