Note: Thread-Safe Concurrent Hash Maps Module
Note: 
Note: This module provides thread-safe hash map implementations optimized
Note: for high concurrency. Uses techniques like segment locking, lock-free
Note: operations, and optimistic concurrency control for maximum performance.
Note:
Note: Thread Safety: Full thread safety with segment-level locking
Note: Performance: O(1) average case with low contention overhead
Note: Memory Model: Uses fine-grained locking and atomic operations
