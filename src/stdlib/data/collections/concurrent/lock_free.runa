Note: Lock-Free Data Structures Module
Note: 
Note: This module provides lock-free data structures that guarantee progress
Note: without using locks or blocking operations. All structures use atomic
Note: operations and memory management techniques like hazard pointers.
Note:
Note: Thread Safety: Lock-free with ABA problem protection
Note: Performance: Wait-free or lock-free progress guarantees
Note: Memory Model: Uses hazard pointers for safe memory reclamation
