Note: Thread-Safe Concurrent Queues Module
Note: 
Note: This module provides high-performance thread-safe queue implementations
Note: for producer-consumer scenarios. Includes bounded and unbounded queues
Note: with different synchronization strategies for various use cases.
Note:
Note: Thread Safety: Full thread safety with optimized locking strategies
Note: Performance: Lock-free where possible, fine-grained locking elsewhere
Note: Memory Model: Uses memory barriers and atomic operations
