Digital Signatures for Data Integrity

This module provides digital signature integration with serialization workflows
for ensuring data integrity and authenticity. It acts as a thin wrapper around
security/crypto modules (asymmetric signatures, hash functions), focusing on
serialization-specific concerns like signed serialized data formats, embedded
vs detached signatures, and signature verification during deserialization.
All cryptographic operations are delegated to security/crypto modules.
