Encryption Key Management

This module provides key management specifically for serialization encryption workflows.
It acts as a thin wrapper around security/crypto/primitives/key_derivation and other
security modules, focusing on serialization-specific concerns like format-specific
key derivation, key rotation for serialized data, and key escrow for data recovery.
All actual cryptographic key operations are delegated to security/crypto modules.
