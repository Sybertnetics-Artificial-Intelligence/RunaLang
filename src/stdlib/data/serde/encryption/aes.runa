AES Encryption for Serialized Data

This module provides high-level AES encryption integration with serialization workflows.
It acts as a thin wrapper around security/crypto/symmetric/aes.runa, handling the
serialize-then-encrypt and decrypt-then-deserialize patterns. This module focuses on
serialization-specific concerns like format metadata encryption, streaming serialized
data encryption, and integration with various serialization formats, while delegating
all actual cryptographic operations to the security/crypto modules.
