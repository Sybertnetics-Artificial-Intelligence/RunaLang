RSA Encryption Integration

This module provides RSA asymmetric encryption integration with serialization workflows.
It acts as a thin wrapper around security/crypto/asymmetric/rsa.runa, focusing on
serialization-specific use cases like key exchange for bulk data encryption,
hybrid encryption schemes for serialized objects, and certificate-based
serialization security. All actual RSA operations are delegated to security/crypto.
