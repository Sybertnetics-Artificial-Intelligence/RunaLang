Hybrid Encryption Schemes

This module provides hybrid encryption schemes specifically for serialization workflows,
combining asymmetric and symmetric encryption for optimal security and performance.
It acts as a thin wrapper around both security/crypto/symmetric and security/crypto/asymmetric
modules, focusing on serialization-specific hybrid patterns like envelope encryption,
multi-recipient serialized data encryption, and key encapsulation for serialization contexts.
All cryptographic operations are delegated to security/crypto modules.
