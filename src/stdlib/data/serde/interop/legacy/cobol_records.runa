COBOL Record Layout and Business Logic Interoperability

This module provides comprehensive COBOL interoperability including:
- Fixed-length record serialization with precise field positioning
- COBOL data types (PIC clauses, COMP fields, packed decimal)
- OCCURS clauses and table handling with variable occurrences
- REDEFINES clause support for union-like structures
- Conditional variables and 88-level condition names
- COBOL copybook parsing and field definition extraction
- Mainframe character sets (EBCDIC/ASCII conversion)
- File organization types (Sequential, Indexed, Relative)
- COBOL arithmetic and rounding rules preservation
- Business logic extraction from PROCEDURE DIVISION
- Screen section and report writer compatibility
- CICS transaction context and DB2 integration
- Legacy date formats and Y2K compliance handling
- COBOL naming conventions and reserved word management
- Multi-level data structures and group item hierarchies
