FORTRAN Array Processing and Scientific Computing Interoperability

This module provides comprehensive FORTRAN interoperability including:
- Multi-dimensional array serialization with column-major ordering
- FORTRAN data types (REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION, COMPLEX, INTEGER)
- Common block serialization for shared variable storage
- EQUIVALENCE statement handling for memory overlays
- Intrinsic function mapping (mathematical, array manipulation)
- FORMAT statement preservation for I/O formatting
- NAMELIST I/O for structured data exchange
- Subroutine and function parameter passing conventions
- FORTRAN 77/90/95/2003/2008 version compatibility
- Array bounds and dynamic allocation handling
- Scientific notation and precision preservation
- Loop construct translation (DO loops, implied DO)
- GOTO statement control flow preservation
- Module system and interface block handling
- Derived type definitions and constructor functions
- Parallel processing directives (OpenMP, MPI integration)
- Legacy punched card format compatibility (fixed-form source)
- High-performance computing optimization preservation
