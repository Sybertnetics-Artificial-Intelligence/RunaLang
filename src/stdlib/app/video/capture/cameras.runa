- Camera metadata and EXIF handling with comprehensive information extraction and processing
- Camera calibration and correction with geometric and color accuracy optimization
- Camera format negotiation and selection with optimal format matching and capability validation
- Camera bandwidth and resource management with efficient allocation and performance optimization
- Camera error handling and recovery with graceful degradation and automatic retry mechanisms
- Camera configuration persistence with settings storage, backup, and restoration capabilities
- Camera integration with system services with platform-specific optimization and native performance
- Camera security and access control with authentication, authorization, and privacy protection

Camera Foundation:
The camera system provides comprehensive device management with professional-grade control,
multi-camera coordination, and real-time monitoring while maintaining cross-platform compatibility
and providing extensible architecture for various camera types and manufacturer integrations.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes device reliability, control precision, multi-camera coordination, and performance optimization
while providing robust error handling and maintaining efficient resource utilization through intelligent
device management and hardware-accelerated processing pipelines for professional video capture workflows.
