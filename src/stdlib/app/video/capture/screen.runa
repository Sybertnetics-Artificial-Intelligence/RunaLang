Screen Capture Foundation:
The screen capture system provides comprehensive desktop recording with professional-grade quality,
multi-monitor coordination, and real-time streaming while maintaining cross-platform compatibility
and providing extensible architecture for various capture scenarios and output requirements.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes capture quality, performance efficiency, user privacy, and workflow integration
while providing robust resource management and maintaining optimal system performance through intelligent
capture optimization and hardware-accelerated processing pipelines for professional screen recording.
