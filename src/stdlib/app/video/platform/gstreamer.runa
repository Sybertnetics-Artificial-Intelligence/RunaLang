Runa Standard Library - Video Platform - GStreamer Multimedia Framework Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive GStreamer multimedia framework integration for
cross-platform multimedia applications. It includes complete pipeline management,
element factory system, plugin architecture, bus messaging, clock synchronization,
and hardware acceleration support with full GStreamer API compatibility and
optimal performance for enterprise multimedia workflows.

The module supports all GStreamer components including sources, sinks, filters,
demuxers, muxers, parsers, and custom elements with automatic capability detection,
format negotiation, and performance optimization. Advanced features include
hardware-accelerated processing, complex filter graphs, network streaming
protocols, and real-time debugging with professional broadcast capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
pipeline optimization, intelligent element selection, automatic configuration
tuning, and predictive performance management for next-generation multimedia
applications.

Key Features:
- Complete GStreamer framework integration with native performance
- Advanced pipeline construction and management with validation
- Professional plugin system with dynamic loading and discovery
- Hardware-accelerated processing with GPU and specialized codec support
- Comprehensive network streaming with RTSP, RTP, and WebRTC protocols
- Real-time debugging and performance analysis with detailed metrics
- Enterprise-grade memory management with zero-copy optimization
