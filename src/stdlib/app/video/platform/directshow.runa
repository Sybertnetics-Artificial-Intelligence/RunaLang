Runa Standard Library - Video Platform - Microsoft DirectShow Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive DirectShow multimedia framework integration for
Windows-based video and audio processing applications. It includes complete filter
graph management, media type negotiation, source/sink filter configuration, device
enumeration, and hardware acceleration support with full DirectShow COM interface
compatibility and performance optimization.

The module supports all DirectShow filter types including source filters, transform
filters, renderer filters, and custom filters with automatic device detection,
format negotiation, and streaming control. Advanced features include hardware-
accelerated video processing, multi-threaded streaming, quality control, and
real-time performance monitoring with professional broadcast capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
filter optimization, intelligent media type selection, automatic configuration
tuning, and predictive performance management for enterprise-grade multimedia
applications.

Key Features:
- Complete DirectShow COM interface integration with error handling
- Advanced filter graph construction and management with validation
- Hardware-accelerated video/audio processing with GPU optimization  
- Multi-threaded streaming with synchronization and flow control
- Professional device enumeration with capability detection
- Real-time quality control and adaptive performance optimization
- Enterprise-grade error handling with automatic recovery mechanisms
