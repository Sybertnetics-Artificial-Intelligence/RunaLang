Runa Standard Library - Video Platform - FFmpeg Multimedia Framework Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive FFmpeg multimedia framework integration for
cross-platform multimedia applications. It includes complete codec management,
format conversion, filtering systems, hardware acceleration, and streaming
support with full libav* library compatibility and optimal performance for
professional media processing workflows.

The module supports all FFmpeg components including encoders, decoders, muxers,
demuxers, filters, and protocols with automatic codec detection, format
negotiation, and quality optimization. Advanced features include hardware-
accelerated encoding/decoding, complex filter graphs, network streaming, and
real-time transcoding with broadcast-quality output capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
encoding optimization, intelligent quality adaptation, automatic parameter
tuning, and predictive performance management for enterprise-grade multimedia
applications.

Key Features:
- Complete FFmpeg framework integration with native performance
- Advanced codec management with hardware acceleration support
- Professional format conversion with quality preservation
- Complex filter graph processing with real-time capabilities  
- Multi-threaded encoding/decoding with optimal resource utilization
- Comprehensive streaming support with network protocols
- Enterprise-grade memory management with performance optimization
