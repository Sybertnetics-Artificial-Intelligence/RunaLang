Runa Standard Library - Video Platform - Apple AVFoundation Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive AVFoundation framework integration for macOS
and iOS multimedia applications. It includes complete capture session management,
media composition and editing, asset library integration, export processing, and
hardware acceleration support with full Core Video, Core Audio, and VideoToolbox
compatibility for professional media workflows.

The module supports all AVFoundation components including capture devices, media
assets, composition tracks, export sessions, and playback controllers with
automatic device configuration, format negotiation, and performance optimization.
Advanced features include hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding, real-time video
processing, metadata management, and multi-track audio mixing with broadcast-
quality output capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
scene analysis, intelligent content optimization, automatic editing assistance,
and predictive media processing for next-generation multimedia applications.

Key Features:
- Complete AVFoundation framework integration with native performance
- Advanced capture session management with device optimization
- Professional media composition and editing with multi-track support
- Hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding with VideoToolbox integration
- Real-time video processing with Core Image and Metal performance
- Comprehensive asset management with metadata and thumbnail generation
- Enterprise-grade export processing with quality control and monitoring
