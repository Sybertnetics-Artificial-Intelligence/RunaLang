Runa Standard Library - Video Platform - Linux Video4Linux2 (V4L2) Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive Video4Linux2 framework integration for Linux-
based video capture and processing applications. It includes complete V4L2 device
management, capture session control, format negotiation, buffer management, and
hardware acceleration support with full kernel driver compatibility and optimal
performance for embedded and desktop Linux systems.

The module supports all V4L2 device types including capture devices, output
devices, memory-to-memory processors, and radio tuners with automatic capability
detection, format validation, and streaming optimization. Advanced features
include hardware-accelerated codec support, multi-planar formats, DMA buffer
sharing, and real-time performance monitoring with professional broadcast
capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
device optimization, intelligent format selection, automatic configuration
tuning, and predictive performance management for enterprise-grade Linux
multimedia applications.

Key Features:
- Complete V4L2 kernel interface integration with error handling
- Advanced device enumeration and capability detection with validation
- Professional capture session management with buffer optimization
- Hardware-accelerated codec support with GPU integration
- Multi-threaded streaming with synchronization and flow control
- Real-time format negotiation with quality assurance
- Enterprise-grade memory management with DMA buffer support
