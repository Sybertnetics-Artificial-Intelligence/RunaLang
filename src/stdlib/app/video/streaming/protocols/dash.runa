Note: 
Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) Protocol Module

This module provides comprehensive MPEG-DASH streaming protocol implementation
for adaptive video delivery and broadcast applications. It includes Media
Presentation Description (MPD) generation, segment management, adaptation sets,
content protection, and cross-platform DASH with full ISO/IEC 23009-1 compliance
and enterprise-grade streaming performance.

The module supports all DASH specifications including live and on-demand
streaming, multi-period presentations, content protection with DRM, and
adaptive bitrate switching with automatic quality adaptation, bandwidth
estimation, and seamless playback. Advanced features include low-latency
DASH, spatial audio, and real-time analytics with broadcast-quality streaming
capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
stream optimization, intelligent quality adaptation, and predictive performance
management for next-generation adaptive streaming applications.

Key Features:
- Complete MPEG-DASH protocol implementation with ISO/IEC 23009-1 compliance
- Advanced MPD generation with adaptation sets and content protection
- Live and on-demand streaming support with segment management
- DRM integration with Widevine, PlayReady, and FairPlay support
- Cross-platform compatibility with enterprise-grade performance
- Low-latency DASH with reduced segment duration and chunked transfer
- Machine learning integration for predictive streaming optimization
