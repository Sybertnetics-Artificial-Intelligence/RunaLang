Note: 
Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) Protocol Module

This module provides comprehensive SRT protocol implementation for low-latency
secure streaming and broadcast applications. It includes encrypted transport,
automatic error recovery, congestion control, bandwidth adaptation, and cross-
platform SRT with full protocol specification compliance and enterprise-grade
streaming performance.

The module supports all SRT features including caller/listener modes, stream
multiplexing, forward error correction, and adaptive bitrate control with
automatic network optimization, packet recovery, and security features.
Advanced features include bandwidth estimation, latency control, and real-time
analytics with broadcast-quality low-latency streaming capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
transport optimization, intelligent error recovery, and predictive performance
management for next-generation low-latency streaming applications.

Key Features:
- Complete SRT protocol implementation with encryption and authentication
- Low-latency transport with configurable latency targets and buffering
- Automatic error recovery with forward error correction and retransmission
- Congestion control with bandwidth adaptation and network optimization
- Cross-platform compatibility with enterprise-grade performance
- Stream multiplexing with caller/listener mode support
- Machine learning integration for predictive transport optimization
