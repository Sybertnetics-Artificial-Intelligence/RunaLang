Note: 
Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) Protocol Module

This module provides comprehensive WebRTC protocol implementation for real-time
peer-to-peer communication and broadcast applications. It includes signaling
protocols, ICE connectivity, media streaming, data channels, security features,
and cross-platform WebRTC with full W3C and IETF specification compliance and
enterprise-grade real-time performance.

The module supports all WebRTC components including peer connections, media
streams, data channels, and signaling with automatic NAT traversal, STUN/TURN
integration, and adaptive quality control. Advanced features include simulcast,
SVC encoding, end-to-end encryption, and real-time analytics with broadcast-
quality interactive streaming capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
connection optimization, intelligent quality adaptation, and predictive
performance management for next-generation real-time communication applications.

Key Features:
- Complete WebRTC protocol implementation with W3C and IETF compliance
- Advanced peer-to-peer connectivity with ICE, STUN, and TURN support
- Real-time media streaming with adaptive quality control
- Secure data channels with end-to-end encryption
- Cross-platform compatibility with enterprise-grade performance
- Simulcast and SVC encoding for optimal bandwidth utilization
- Machine learning integration for predictive connection optimization
