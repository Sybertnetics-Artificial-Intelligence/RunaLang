Note: 
Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) Protocol Module

This module provides comprehensive HTTP Live Streaming protocol implementation
for adaptive video delivery and broadcast applications. It includes manifest
generation, segment management, adaptive bitrate streaming, playlist processing,
and cross-platform HLS with full protocol compliance and enterprise-grade
streaming performance.

The module supports all HLS specifications including master playlists, media
playlists, segment encryption, and adaptive bitrate switching with automatic
quality adaptation, bandwidth detection, and seamless playback. Advanced
features include content protection, low-latency HLS, and real-time analytics
with broadcast-quality streaming capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
stream optimization, intelligent quality adaptation, and predictive performance
management for next-generation adaptive streaming applications.

Key Features:
- Complete HLS protocol implementation with manifest and segment management
- Adaptive bitrate streaming with automatic quality switching
- Content protection with AES encryption and DRM integration
- Low-latency HLS support with reduced segment duration
- Cross-platform compatibility with enterprise-grade performance
- Comprehensive playlist processing with validation and optimization
- Machine learning integration for predictive streaming optimization
