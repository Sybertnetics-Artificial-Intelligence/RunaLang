Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) Module

This module provides comprehensive RTMP streaming protocol implementation for
professional video streaming applications. It includes RTMP handshaking, chunk
streaming, message handling, connection management, and stream publishing/
subscribing with full protocol compliance and performance optimization.

The module supports RTMP, RTMPS (secure), RTMPE (encrypted), and RTMPT (tunneled)
variants with adaptive streaming capabilities, metadata handling, and real-time
communication features. All processing maintains broadcast-quality video delivery
with robust error handling and connection recovery mechanisms.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
stream optimization, intelligent quality adaptation, and real-time analytics
without embedded AI processing.

Key Features:
- Complete RTMP protocol implementation with all variants (RTMP, RTMPS, RTMPE, RTMPT)
- Professional handshaking and chunk streaming with protocol compliance
- Real-time stream publishing and subscribing with quality optimization
- Robust connection management with automatic recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive metadata handling with broadcast-quality delivery
- Cross-platform compatibility with enterprise-grade performance
- Machine learning integration for predictive stream optimization
