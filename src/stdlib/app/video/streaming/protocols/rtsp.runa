Note: 
Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) Module

This module provides comprehensive RTSP protocol implementation for streaming
media control and broadcast applications. It includes session management, media
delivery control, authentication mechanisms, transport negotiation, and cross-
platform RTSP with full RFC 7826 compliance and enterprise-grade streaming
performance.

The module supports all RTSP features including PLAY, PAUSE, TEARDOWN commands,
RTP/RTCP transport, digest authentication, and session management with automatic
connection handling, media synchronization, and quality control. Advanced
features include RTSP over HTTP tunneling, multicast support, and real-time
analytics with broadcast-quality streaming capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
session optimization, intelligent transport selection, and predictive performance
management for next-generation streaming control applications.

Key Features:
- Complete RTSP protocol implementation with RFC 7826 compliance
- Advanced session management with authentication and authorization
- RTP/RTCP transport integration with media synchronization
- RTSP over HTTP tunneling for firewall traversal
- Cross-platform compatibility with enterprise-grade performance
- Multicast and unicast streaming support with load balancing
- Machine learning integration for predictive session optimization
