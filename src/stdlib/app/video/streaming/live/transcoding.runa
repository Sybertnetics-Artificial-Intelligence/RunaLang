Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Real-Time Transcoding Module

This module provides comprehensive real-time transcoding capabilities for live
streaming and broadcast applications. It includes multi-format encoding/decoding,
hardware acceleration, adaptive quality control, distributed processing, and
cross-platform transcoding with full compatibility for modern streaming protocols
and enterprise-grade broadcast performance.

The module supports all major codecs including H.264, H.265, VP9, and AV1 with
automatic format detection, quality optimization, and resource management.
Advanced features include GPU acceleration, distributed transcoding clusters,
and real-time analytics with broadcast-quality stream processing capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
transcoding optimization, intelligent quality adaptation, automatic parameter
tuning, and predictive resource management for next-generation broadcasting
applications.

Key Features:
- Multi-codec transcoding with hardware acceleration support
- Real-time quality control with adaptive bitrate management  
- Distributed processing with load balancing and scalability
- GPU optimization with CUDA, OpenCL, and specialized codec support
- Cross-platform transcoding with protocol compatibility
- Machine learning integration for predictive transcoding optimization
- Enterprise-grade performance monitoring and resource analytics
