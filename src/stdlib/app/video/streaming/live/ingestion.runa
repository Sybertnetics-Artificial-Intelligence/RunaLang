Note: 
Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Live Stream Ingestion Module

This module provides comprehensive live stream ingestion capabilities for
real-time broadcasting and content delivery. It includes multi-protocol stream
input support, real-time processing pipelines, stream validation, quality
assurance, transcoding integration, and cross-platform ingestion with full
compatibility for modern streaming protocols and enterprise-grade broadcast
performance.

The module supports all major ingestion protocols including RTMP, SRT, WebRTC,
and custom protocols with automatic stream detection, format validation, and
quality monitoring. Advanced features include adaptive transcoding, multi-stream
handling, redundant ingestion, and real-time analytics with broadcast-quality
stream processing capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
stream optimization, intelligent quality adaptation, automatic parameter tuning,
and predictive ingestion management for next-generation broadcasting
applications.

Key Features:
- Multi-protocol stream ingestion with RTMP, SRT, and WebRTC support
- Real-time stream validation with comprehensive quality monitoring
- Adaptive transcoding pipeline with hardware acceleration
- Redundant ingestion with automatic failover capabilities
- Cross-platform ingestion optimization with protocol compatibility
- Machine learning integration for predictive stream management
- Enterprise-grade performance monitoring and broadcast analytics
