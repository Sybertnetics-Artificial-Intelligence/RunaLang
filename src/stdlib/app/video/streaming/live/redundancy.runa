Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Live Stream Redundancy and Failover Module

This module provides comprehensive redundancy and failover capabilities for
enterprise live streaming infrastructure. It includes multi-path streaming,
automatic failover detection, backup server management, stream quality assurance,
and cross-platform redundancy with full compatibility for modern streaming
protocols and enterprise-grade reliability performance.

The module supports all major redundancy strategies including active-active,
active-passive, and load-balanced configurations with automatic failure
detection, seamless switching, and quality preservation. Advanced features
include geographic distribution, intelligent failover decisions, and real-time
monitoring with broadcast-quality reliability capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
failure prediction, intelligent failover optimization, automatic parameter
tuning, and predictive reliability management for next-generation streaming
applications.

Key Features:
- Multi-path streaming with automatic load balancing and failover
- Comprehensive failover detection with predictive failure analysis
- Geographic redundancy with distributed backup infrastructure  
- Stream quality assurance with seamless switching capabilities
- Cross-platform redundancy with protocol compatibility
- Machine learning integration for predictive failure management
- Enterprise-grade reliability monitoring and disaster recovery
