Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Adaptive Quality Control Module

This module provides comprehensive adaptive quality streaming capabilities for
optimal viewer experience optimization. It includes intelligent quality selection
algorithms, perceptual quality assessment, content-aware adaptation, quality
switching logic, and cross-platform quality management with full compatibility
for modern streaming protocols and enterprise-grade performance optimization.

The module supports all major quality adaptation approaches including VMAF-based
optimization, content complexity analysis, and perceptual quality models with
automatic quality ladder generation, seamless switching, and viewer satisfaction
maximization. Advanced features include machine learning-driven quality
prediction, multi-metric optimization, and real-time analytics with broadcast-
quality streaming capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
quality optimization, intelligent content analysis, automatic parameter tuning,
and predictive viewer experience management for next-generation streaming
applications.

Key Features:
- Intelligent quality selection with multiple optimization algorithms
- Perceptual quality assessment with VMAF and SSIM metrics
- Content-aware adaptation with complexity analysis
- Seamless quality switching with minimal viewer disruption
- Cross-platform quality management with protocol compatibility
- Machine learning integration for predictive optimization
- Enterprise-grade performance monitoring and analytics
