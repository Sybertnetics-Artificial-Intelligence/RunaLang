Note: 
Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) Control Module

This module provides comprehensive adaptive bitrate streaming capabilities for
dynamic video quality optimization. It includes intelligent bitrate selection
algorithms, real-time bandwidth estimation, buffer health monitoring, quality
switching logic, and cross-platform ABR implementation with full compatibility
for modern streaming protocols and enterprise-grade performance optimization.

The module supports all major ABR algorithms including buffer-based, throughput-
based, and hybrid approaches with automatic quality ladder generation, seamless
switching, and viewer experience optimization. Advanced features include machine
learning-driven adaptation, multi-CDN support, and real-time analytics with
broadcast-quality streaming capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
bitrate optimization, intelligent quality prediction, automatic parameter tuning,
and predictive viewer experience management for next-generation streaming
applications.

Key Features:
- Intelligent bitrate selection with multiple adaptation algorithms
- Real-time bandwidth estimation with network condition monitoring  
- Buffer health analysis with proactive quality adjustment
- Seamless quality switching with minimal viewer disruption
- Cross-platform ABR implementation with protocol compatibility
- Machine learning integration for predictive optimization
- Enterprise-grade performance monitoring and analytics
