Note: 
Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Adaptive Content Delivery Network (CDN) Module

This module provides comprehensive adaptive content delivery network capabilities
for global streaming optimization and edge distribution. It includes intelligent
edge caching algorithms, dynamic content distribution, load balancing, geographic
routing, and cross-platform CDN integration with full compatibility for modern
streaming protocols and enterprise-grade global delivery performance.

The module supports all major CDN strategies including intelligent cache placement,
preemptive content distribution, and adaptive load balancing with automatic edge
server selection, content popularity tracking, and network optimization. Advanced
features include machine learning-driven cache decisions, multi-CDN orchestration,
and real-time delivery analytics with broadcast-quality global streaming
capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
CDN optimization, intelligent content placement, automatic parameter tuning, and
predictive global delivery management for next-generation streaming applications.

Key Features:
- Intelligent edge caching with adaptive placement algorithms
- Dynamic content distribution with popularity-based optimization
- Geographic routing with latency-aware server selection
- Multi-CDN orchestration with seamless failover capabilities
- Cross-platform CDN integration with protocol compatibility
- Machine learning integration for predictive cache management
- Enterprise-grade global performance monitoring and analytics
