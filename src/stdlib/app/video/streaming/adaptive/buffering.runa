Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Adaptive Buffering Management Module

This module provides comprehensive adaptive buffering capabilities for optimal
streaming performance and viewer experience. It includes intelligent buffer
management algorithms, prefetching strategies, buffer health monitoring, cache
optimization, and cross-platform buffering with full compatibility for modern
streaming protocols and enterprise-grade performance optimization.

The module supports all major buffering strategies including predictive buffering,
adaptive prefetching, and intelligent cache management with automatic buffer
size optimization, stall prevention, and memory efficiency. Advanced features
include machine learning-driven buffering decisions, multi-tier caching, and
real-time buffer analytics with broadcast-quality streaming capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
buffer optimization, intelligent prefetching, automatic parameter tuning, and
predictive buffer management for next-generation streaming applications.

Key Features:
- Intelligent buffer management with adaptive sizing algorithms
- Predictive prefetching with content awareness and user behavior analysis
- Multi-tier caching with memory and storage optimization
- Buffer health monitoring with stall prevention and recovery
- Cross-platform buffering optimization with protocol compatibility
- Machine learning integration for predictive buffer management
- Enterprise-grade performance monitoring and buffer analytics
