Runa Standard Library - Video Streaming - Adaptive Bandwidth Management Module

This module provides comprehensive adaptive bandwidth management capabilities for
optimal network utilization and streaming performance. It includes intelligent
bandwidth estimation algorithms, network condition monitoring, congestion control,
QoS management, and cross-platform bandwidth optimization with full compatibility
for modern streaming protocols and enterprise-grade network performance.

The module supports all major bandwidth estimation techniques including throughput-
based measurement, RTT analysis, and hybrid approaches with automatic network
condition detection, congestion avoidance, and traffic shaping. Advanced features
include machine learning-driven bandwidth prediction, multi-path optimization,
and real-time network analytics with broadcast-quality streaming capabilities.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
bandwidth optimization, intelligent network analysis, automatic parameter tuning,
and predictive network performance management for next-generation streaming
applications.

Key Features:
- Intelligent bandwidth estimation with multiple measurement algorithms
- Real-time network condition monitoring with congestion detection
- QoS management with traffic shaping and priority control
- Multi-path bandwidth optimization with load balancing
- Cross-platform network optimization with protocol compatibility
- Machine learning integration for predictive bandwidth management
- Enterprise-grade performance monitoring and network analytics
