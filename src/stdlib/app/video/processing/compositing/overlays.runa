Video Text Overlays and Graphics System

This module provides comprehensive overlay functionality for video compositing applications including:
- Text rendering with advanced typography control and font management systems
- Graphic overlay positioning and scaling with precise placement and transformation controls
- Animated text and graphic elements with keyframe animation and motion curves
- Subtitle and caption generation with timing synchronization and formatting options
- Logo and watermark placement with transparency, scaling, and positioning controls
- Lower thirds and title graphics with template-based creation and custom styling
- Shape and vector graphics overlay with scalable graphics and geometric primitives
- Image overlay with transparency support and alpha channel compositing
- Motion graphics and animated elements with particle systems and dynamic effects
- Text styling and formatting options with rich text support and style inheritance
- Overlay templates and presets with customizable designs and rapid deployment
- Multi-language text rendering with Unicode support and international typography
- Overlay tracking and stabilization with motion-locked positioning and perspective correction
- Real-time overlay preview with interactive editing and immediate visual feedback
- Overlay compositing with blend modes and advanced mixing algorithms
- Overlay animation and effects with smooth transitions and visual enhancements
- Overlay export and rendering with format-specific optimization and quality control
- Overlay batch processing with consistent application across multiple clips
- Overlay performance optimization with GPU acceleration and memory efficiency
- Professional overlay workflows with broadcast and cinema standards compliance

Overlay Foundation:
The overlay system provides professional-grade text and graphics compositing with advanced
typography, animation capabilities, and real-time performance while maintaining optimal visual
quality and supporting complex overlay compositions for professional video production.
