Video Transitions and Effects System

This module provides comprehensive transition functionality for video compositing applications including:
- Smooth transitions between video clips with interpolation and blending algorithms
- Fade, dissolve, and wipe transitions with customizable parameters and timing controls
- 3D transitions and transformations with perspective effects and spatial manipulation
- Custom transition creation tools with user-defined parameters and algorithmic control
- Transition timing and easing controls with curve-based animation and smooth acceleration
- Motion blur and directional transitions with realistic movement simulation and blur effects
- Particle and organic transitions with natural-looking effects and procedural generation
- Audio-synchronized transitions with beat detection and rhythm-based timing synchronization
- Transition preview and scrubbing with real-time playback and interactive timeline navigation
- Transition templates and presets with professionally designed effects and rapid application
- Seamless loop transitions with perfect continuity and cyclic animation support
- Multi-layer transition effects with complex compositing and hierarchical blending
- Transition color correction with automatic matching and manual adjustment capabilities
- GPU-accelerated transition rendering with parallel processing and optimized performance
- Real-time transition preview with interactive editing and immediate visual feedback
- Transition automation and batching with consistent application across multiple clips
- Transition export and sharing with format optimization and cross-platform compatibility
- Transition performance optimization with caching, streaming, and memory management
- Advanced transition mathematics with procedural algorithms and parametric control
- Professional transition workflows with broadcast and cinema standards compliance

Transition Foundation:
The transition system provides professional-grade scene change effects with smooth interpolation,
advanced blending techniques, and real-time performance while maintaining optimal visual
quality and supporting complex transition compositions for professional video production.
