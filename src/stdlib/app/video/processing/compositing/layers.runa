Video Layer Management and Blending System

This module provides comprehensive layer management functionality for video compositing applications including:
- Layer composition with multiple blend modes and advanced mixing algorithms
- Opacity control and layer ordering with hierarchical organization and priority management
- Transform operations on layers with scale, rotation, and position controls
- Layer grouping and nesting with parent-child relationships and inheritance properties
- Blend mode operations including normal, multiply, screen, overlay, and custom modes
- Layer masking and clipping with vector and raster mask support and feathering
- Layer visibility and locking with selective editing and protection controls
- Layer effects and filters with real-time preview and parameter adjustment
- Layer animation and keyframing with smooth interpolation and easing functions
- Layer sorting and organization with tagging, filtering, and search capabilities
- Layer duplicate and copy operations with smart reference management
- Layer metadata and properties with custom attributes and data persistence
- Layer composition with GPU acceleration and parallel processing optimization
- Real-time layer preview with interactive editing and immediate feedback
- Layer export and rendering with format-specific optimization and quality control
- Multi-resolution layer handling with automatic scaling and quality preservation
- Layer color correction with per-layer grading and selective adjustments
- Layer positioning and alignment with smart guides and magnetic snapping
- Layer performance optimization with caching, streaming, and memory management
- Professional layer workflows with broadcast and cinema standards compliance

Layer Management Foundation:
The layer management system provides professional-grade compositing capabilities with advanced
blending, hierarchical organization, and real-time performance while maintaining optimal visual
quality and supporting complex multi-layer compositions for professional video production.
