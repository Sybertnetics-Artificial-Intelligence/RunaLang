Video Batch Encoding and Queuing System

This module provides comprehensive batch processing functionality for video encoding applications including:
- Automated batch processing workflows with intelligent job orchestration and execution management
- Job queue management and scheduling with priority-based processing and resource optimization
- Priority-based encoding queues with dynamic reordering and deadline-aware scheduling
- Distributed encoding across multiple nodes with load balancing and fault tolerance
- Progress monitoring and status reporting with real-time updates and completion tracking
- Error handling and retry mechanisms with intelligent failure recovery and notification systems
- Resource allocation and load balancing with CPU, GPU, and memory optimization strategies
- Concurrent encoding operations with parallel processing and thread-safe queue management
- Job dependency management with prerequisite tracking and sequential workflow execution
- Encoding job templates and presets with standardized configurations and rapid deployment
- Completion notifications and alerts with email, webhook, and dashboard integration
- Resume and pause functionality with state persistence and checkpoint-based recovery
- Batch processing analytics with performance metrics and efficiency analysis reporting
- Job history and logging with comprehensive audit trails and debugging information
- Automated quality assurance with post-processing validation and compliance checking
- Conditional processing workflows with rule-based execution and dynamic path selection
- Batch optimization strategies with content-aware scheduling and resource prediction
- Integration with external systems including cloud services, storage, and content management
- Scalable processing architecture with horizontal scaling and auto-provisioning capabilities
- Professional batch workflows with enterprise-grade reliability and monitoring systems

Batch Processing Foundation:
The batch processing system provides enterprise-grade encoding automation with intelligent
scheduling, distributed processing, and comprehensive monitoring while maintaining optimal
efficiency and reliability for large-scale professional video production workflows.
