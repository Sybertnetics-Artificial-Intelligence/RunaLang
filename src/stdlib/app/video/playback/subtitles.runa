Subtitle Foundation:
The subtitle system provides comprehensive text rendering with professional-grade quality,
multi-language support, and accessibility compliance while maintaining cross-platform compatibility
and providing extensible architecture for various subtitle formats and presentation requirements.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes subtitle quality, accessibility, multi-language support, and user experience
while providing robust rendering and maintaining optimal display performance through intelligent
subtitle algorithms and hardware-accelerated text rendering for professional video playback.
