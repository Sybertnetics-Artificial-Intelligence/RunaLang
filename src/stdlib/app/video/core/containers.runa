Container Foundation:
The video container system provides comprehensive stream management and format handling
capabilities with professional-grade multiplexing, synchronization, and metadata support
while maintaining cross-platform compatibility and extensible architecture for custom formats.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes stream synchronization, format compatibility, metadata preservation, and performance
optimization while providing robust error handling and maintaining efficient processing through
intelligent container management and optimized stream interleaving for professional workflows.
