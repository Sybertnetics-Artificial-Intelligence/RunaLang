Format Foundation:
The video format system provides comprehensive format handling capabilities with professional-grade
parsing, conversion, and optimization while maintaining cross-platform compatibility and providing
extensible architecture for custom format support and third-party integration.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes format compatibility, conversion accuracy, performance optimization, and extensibility
while providing robust error handling and maintaining efficient processing through intelligent
format detection and optimized conversion pipelines for professional video workflows.
