Codec Foundation:
The video codec system provides comprehensive encoding and decoding capabilities with hardware
acceleration, intelligent codec selection, and professional-grade quality while maintaining
cross-platform compatibility and providing extensible architecture for custom codec support.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes encoding quality, performance optimization, hardware utilization, and codec flexibility
while providing robust error handling and maintaining efficient processing through intelligent
codec selection and hardware-accelerated encoding pipelines for professional video workflows.
