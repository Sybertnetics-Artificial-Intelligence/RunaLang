Circular and Radial Layout Module

This module provides comprehensive circular and radial layout algorithms for visualization.
Supports circle packing, radial trees, arc diagrams, chord layouts, and polar coordinates.

Core Functionality:
- Circular layouts: single circle, concentric circles, spiral arrangements
- Radial trees: sunburst, radial dendrograms, balloon trees
- Arc diagrams: network arcs, hierarchical arcs, bundled arcs
- Chord diagrams: relationship visualization, flow diagrams
- Circle packing: hierarchical circles, bubble charts, packed circles
- Polar coordinates: radar charts, rose diagrams, circular histograms
- Optimization: even distribution, minimal crossings, aesthetic placement
- Interactive features: rotation, expansion, focus+context

Applications include network visualization, hierarchical data, periodic data,
relationship diagrams, and space-efficient layouts.
