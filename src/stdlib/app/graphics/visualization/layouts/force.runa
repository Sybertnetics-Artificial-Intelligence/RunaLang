Force-Directed Layout Module

This module provides comprehensive force-directed layout algorithms for network visualization.
Supports spring models, gravity simulation, collision detection, and energy minimization.

Core Functionality:
- Force simulation: attraction, repulsion, gravity, collision forces
- Layout algorithms: Fruchterman-Reingold, Kamada-Kawai, ForceAtlas2
- Constraints: fixed positions, boundaries, alignment, grouping
- Optimization: Barnes-Hut approximation, quadtree, cooling schedules
- Interactive simulation: dragging, pinning, real-time updates
- Multi-level approaches: coarsening, refinement, hierarchical layout
- Force customization: custom force functions, variable strengths
- Stabilization: convergence detection, energy minimization, damping

Applications include social networks, knowledge graphs, molecular structures,
system architectures, dependency diagrams, and relationship visualization.
