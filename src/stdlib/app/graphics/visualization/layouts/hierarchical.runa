Hierarchical Layout Module

This module provides comprehensive hierarchical layout algorithms for tree and graph structures.
Supports various tree layouts, dendrograms, organizational charts, and nested hierarchies.

Core Functionality:
- Tree layouts: top-down, left-right, radial, balloon trees
- Layout algorithms: Reingold-Tilford, Walker's algorithm, compact trees
- Node positioning: level-based, breadth-first, depth-first arrangements
- Edge routing: straight, orthogonal, curved, bundled edges
- Compaction: minimizing whitespace, balanced subtrees, symmetry
- Interactive features: collapse/expand, focus+context, zooming
- Performance optimization: incremental layout, cached positions, lazy evaluation
- Customization: node sizes, variable spacing, custom positioning

Applications include organizational charts, file system visualization, taxonomies,
decision trees, genealogy trees, and hierarchical clustering visualization.
