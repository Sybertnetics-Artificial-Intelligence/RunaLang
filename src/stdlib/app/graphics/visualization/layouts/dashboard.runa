Dashboard Layout Module

This module provides comprehensive dashboard composition and layout management.
Supports widget placement, responsive panels, drag-and-drop arrangement, and layout persistence.

Core Functionality:
- Layout systems: grid-based, flexible boxes, absolute positioning, nested panels
- Widget management: add, remove, resize, reorder widgets
- Responsive design: breakpoints, adaptive layouts, mobile/desktop views
- Drag and drop: widget rearrangement, resize handles, snap-to-grid
- Layout templates: predefined layouts, custom templates, layout switching
- State persistence: save/load layouts, user preferences, configuration
- Panel types: charts, tables, metrics, filters, controls, custom widgets
- Performance: lazy loading, virtual scrolling, widget lifecycle management

Applications include business intelligence, monitoring dashboards, control panels,
data exploration interfaces, and customizable workspaces.
