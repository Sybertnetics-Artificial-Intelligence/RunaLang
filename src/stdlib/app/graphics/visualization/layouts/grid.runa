Grid Layout Module

This module provides comprehensive grid layout algorithms for visualization arrangement.
Supports regular grids, small multiples, and responsive grid systems.

Core Functionality:
- Grid types: uniform grid, responsive grid, masonry, packed grid
- Cell arrangement: row-major, column-major, spiral, custom patterns
- Spacing control: gaps, padding, margins, dynamic spacing
- Aspect ratios: fixed, flexible, content-based, golden ratio
- Responsive behavior: breakpoints, reflow, adaptive columns
- Alignment options: start, center, end, stretch, baseline
- Nested grids: subgrids, recursive layouts, hierarchical grids
- Performance: virtual scrolling, lazy rendering, viewport optimization

Applications include dashboard layouts, small multiples, image galleries,
data tables, card layouts, and responsive visualizations.
