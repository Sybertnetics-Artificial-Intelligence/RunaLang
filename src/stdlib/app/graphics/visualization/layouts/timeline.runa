Timeline and Temporal Layout Module

This module provides comprehensive timeline and temporal layout algorithms for visualization.
Supports Gantt charts, event timelines, temporal sequences, and time-based arrangements.

Core Functionality:
- Timeline types: linear, logarithmic, calendar-based, cyclical
- Event positioning: point events, interval events, overlapping events
- Gantt charts: project timelines, resource allocation, dependencies
- Time scales: multiple granularities, zoom levels, date formatting
- Layout strategies: swimlanes, stacked events, parallel timelines
- Temporal aggregation: binning, clustering, summarization
- Interactive features: panning, zooming, brushing time ranges
- Annotations: milestones, phases, periods, highlights

Applications include project management, historical visualization, event analysis,
scheduling systems, and temporal pattern discovery.
