Canvas Rendering Module

This module provides comprehensive HTML5 Canvas-based rendering for raster graphics.
Supports immediate mode rendering, pixel manipulation, and high-performance drawing.

Core Functionality:
- Drawing primitives: lines, shapes, curves, text, images
- Context management: save/restore states, transformations, clipping
- Pixel manipulation: direct pixel access, image data operations
- Performance optimization: offscreen canvas, batch rendering, dirty rectangles
- Animation: requestAnimationFrame, double buffering, frame management
- Compositing: blend modes, alpha channel, layering
- Image processing: filters, convolution, color manipulation
- WebGL fallback: hardware acceleration when available

Applications include real-time visualizations, games, image editors,
scientific plotting, and performance-critical graphics.
