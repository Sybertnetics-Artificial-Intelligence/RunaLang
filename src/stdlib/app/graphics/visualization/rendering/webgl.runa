WebGL Rendering Module

This module provides comprehensive WebGL-accelerated rendering for 3D and high-performance graphics.
Supports shader programs, GPU computation, instanced rendering, and texture management.

Core Functionality:
- Shader management: vertex/fragment shaders, compilation, linking, uniforms
- Buffer operations: VBOs, IBOs, VAOs, buffer management
- Texture handling: 2D/3D textures, mipmaps, framebuffers, render targets
- Instanced rendering: draw many objects efficiently, instance attributes
- GPU computation: compute shaders, parallel processing, GPGPU
- Performance optimization: batching, culling, LOD, state management
- Advanced techniques: deferred rendering, shadow mapping, post-processing
- WebGL2 features: transform feedback, multiple render targets, 3D textures

Applications include 3D visualization, large-scale data rendering, scientific visualization,
real-time graphics, and GPU-accelerated computation.
