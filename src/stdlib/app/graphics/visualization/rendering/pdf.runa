PDF Rendering Module

This module provides comprehensive PDF export and rendering for print-quality output.
Supports vector graphics, multi-page documents, fonts, and print layouts.

Core Functionality:
- Document creation: page setup, margins, orientation, paper sizes
- Vector graphics: paths, shapes, lines, curves with PDF precision
- Text rendering: fonts, styles, paragraphs, text flow, encoding
- Image embedding: raster images, compression, color spaces
- Multi-page support: page breaks, headers, footers, page numbering
- Layout control: columns, tables, positioning, alignment
- Annotations: links, bookmarks, comments, form fields
- Print optimization: color management, bleeds, crop marks

Applications include report generation, print layouts, archival documents,
publication-quality graphics, and data export.
