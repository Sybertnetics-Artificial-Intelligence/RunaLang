Bitmap Rendering Module

This module provides comprehensive bitmap image export and rendering capabilities.
Supports PNG, JPEG, WebP formats, high-DPI rendering, and image compression.

Core Functionality:
- Image formats: PNG, JPEG, WebP, BMP, TIFF export
- Color spaces: RGB, RGBA, grayscale, indexed color
- High-DPI support: retina displays, resolution scaling
- Compression: lossy/lossless, quality settings, optimization
- Image processing: resizing, cropping, filtering, transformations
- Metadata: EXIF data, color profiles, comments
- Batch processing: multiple exports, format conversion
- Performance: multi-threading, streaming, memory management

Applications include screenshot capture, chart export, thumbnail generation,
image conversion, and print-resolution output.
