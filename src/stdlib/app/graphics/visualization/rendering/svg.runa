SVG Rendering Module

This module provides comprehensive SVG-based rendering for scalable vector graphics.
Supports path generation, DOM manipulation, animations, and interactive elements.

Core Functionality:
- Element creation: shapes, paths, text, groups, patterns, gradients
- Path generation: lines, curves, arcs, complex paths, path morphing
- Transformations: translate, rotate, scale, skew, matrix transforms
- Styling: CSS integration, inline styles, style sheets, themes
- Animation: SMIL animations, CSS animations, JavaScript control
- Interactivity: events, hover effects, clickable elements, tooltips
- Filters: blur, shadows, color manipulation, custom filters
- Performance: DOM optimization, virtual DOM, batch updates

Applications include data visualization, interactive diagrams, scalable graphics,
web-based charts, and resolution-independent rendering.
