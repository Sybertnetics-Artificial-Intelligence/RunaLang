Streaming Rendering Module

This module provides comprehensive real-time data streaming and incremental rendering capabilities.
Supports WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, progressive updates, and backpressure handling.

Core Functionality:
- Stream protocols: WebSockets, SSE, HTTP streaming, custom protocols
- Data handling: buffering, chunking, windowing, aggregation
- Incremental rendering: partial updates, diff-based rendering, delta compression
- Backpressure: flow control, buffer management, dropping strategies
- Performance: async processing, worker threads, stream optimization
- Error handling: reconnection, data recovery, fault tolerance
- Synchronization: time alignment, ordering, consistency
- Monitoring: throughput, latency, buffer metrics

Applications include real-time dashboards, live data visualization, streaming analytics,
financial tickers, and monitoring systems.
