Interactive Tooltips Module

This module provides comprehensive tooltip and detail-on-demand functionality for visualizations.
Supports rich content, smart positioning, and contextual information display.

Core Functionality:
- Tooltip types: text, HTML, charts, images, custom content
- Positioning strategies: smart placement, follow cursor, fixed, anchored
- Trigger modes: hover, click, focus, proximity, programmatic
- Content generation: static, dynamic, async loading, templated
- Styling options: themes, animations, shadows, borders, transparency
- Multi-tooltip support: comparison tooltips, linked tooltips, tooltip trails
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader support, focus management
- Performance: lazy loading, caching, viewport culling, debouncing

Applications include data exploration, contextual help, progressive disclosure,
comparison views, and enhanced user guidance.
