Interactive View Linking Module

This module provides comprehensive view linking and coordination for multi-view visualizations.
Supports brushing and linking, synchronized interactions, and coordinated visual encoding.

Core Functionality:
- Link types: selection links, filter links, navigation links, encoding links
- Coordination patterns: master-detail, overview-detail, small multiples, focus+context
- Link propagation: immediate, animated, conditional, bidirectional
- Data relationships: shared data, derived data, aggregated views, drill-through
- Interaction coupling: tight coupling, loose coupling, selective coupling
- Visual consistency: shared scales, color mappings, symbol mappings
- State synchronization: view states, interaction states, animation states
- Performance optimization: lazy updates, batched updates, differential updates

Applications include dashboard coordination, exploratory analysis, comparative visualization,
multi-scale exploration, and cross-view pattern discovery.
