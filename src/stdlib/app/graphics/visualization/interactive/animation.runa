Interactive Animation Module

This module provides comprehensive animation capabilities for data visualization transitions.
Supports smooth state changes, data updates, and narrative storytelling through animation.

Core Functionality:
- Animation types: enter/exit, update, morph, transition animations
- Timing control: duration, delay, easing functions, sequencing
- Data animation: interpolation, tweening, morphing between datasets
- Object animation: position, scale, rotation, opacity, color transitions
- Animation orchestration: timelines, sequences, parallel animations
- Performance optimization: RAF scheduling, GPU acceleration, batching
- Interactive control: play/pause, speed control, scrubbing, stepping
- Animation patterns: stagger, wave, cascade, random, custom patterns

Applications include data storytelling, state transitions, attention guidance,
temporal visualization, and engaging user experiences.
