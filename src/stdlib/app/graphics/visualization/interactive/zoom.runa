Interactive Zoom and Pan Module

This module provides comprehensive zoom and pan functionality for interactive visualizations.
Supports smooth transitions, gesture controls, and programmatic navigation.

Core Functionality:
- Viewport management: zoom levels, pan offsets, coordinate transformations
- User interaction: mouse wheel zoom, drag-to-pan, pinch gestures
- Programmatic control: zoom to fit, zoom to region, animated transitions
- Constraint handling: zoom limits, pan boundaries, aspect ratio preservation
- Multi-scale rendering: level-of-detail, semantic zooming, progressive loading
- Touch support: pinch-to-zoom, two-finger pan, momentum scrolling
- Keyboard navigation: arrow keys, zoom shortcuts, reset view
- History tracking: undo/redo navigation, saved views, bookmarks

Applications include data exploration, map navigation, image viewers,
scientific visualization, and interactive dashboards.
