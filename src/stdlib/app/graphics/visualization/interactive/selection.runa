Interactive Selection and Brushing Module

This module provides comprehensive selection and brushing functionality for data visualization.
Supports multiple selection modes, linked brushing, and visual feedback mechanisms.

Core Functionality:
- Selection modes: point, rectangle, lasso, polygon, range-based selection
- Multi-selection: additive, subtractive, toggle, intersection modes
- Brushing techniques: linked brushing, cross-filtering, highlight propagation
- Selection persistence: save, restore, share selection states
- Visual feedback: highlighting, dimming, color coding, animations
- Selection queries: spatial queries, attribute-based, proximity selection
- Group selection: hierarchical selection, category-based, cluster selection
- Selection history: undo/redo, selection trails, comparison modes

Applications include exploratory data analysis, multi-view coordination,
interactive filtering, pattern discovery, and subset analysis.
