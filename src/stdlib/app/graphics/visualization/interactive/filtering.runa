Interactive Filtering Module

This module provides comprehensive interactive filtering capabilities for data visualization.
Supports dynamic queries, faceted filtering, and real-time data subsetting.

Core Functionality:
- Filter types: range sliders, checkboxes, dropdown menus, search boxes
- Filter logic: AND/OR/NOT combinations, nested conditions, custom predicates
- Dynamic queries: real-time filtering, progressive refinement, query building
- Faceted search: multi-dimensional filtering, filter hierarchies, dependencies
- Performance optimization: indexed filtering, incremental updates, caching
- Filter visualization: histograms, range indicators, active filter badges
- Filter persistence: save/load filter sets, shareable URLs, filter templates
- Smart filtering: suggestions, auto-complete, related filters, common patterns

Applications include data exploration, search interfaces, dashboard controls,
report generation, and analytical workflows.
