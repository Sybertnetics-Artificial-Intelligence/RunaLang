Runa Standard Library - 2D Graphics - Basic Shapes and Primitives Module

This module provides comprehensive 2D shape drawing capabilities for graphics
applications. It includes basic geometric primitives (lines, rectangles, circles,
polygons), complex shapes, path construction, curve generation, and geometric
operations with high-quality rendering and mathematical precision.

The module supports various drawing modes, fill patterns, stroke styles, and
geometric transformations. All processing maintains professional graphics quality
with support for anti-aliasing, sub-pixel accuracy, and efficient rendering
algorithms for both interactive and batch graphics operations.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
shape analysis, intelligent path optimization, and adaptive rendering
capabilities without embedded AI processing.
