Note: 
Runa Standard Library - 2D Graphics - Text Rendering and Typography Module

This module provides comprehensive text rendering capabilities for 2D graphics
applications. It includes font loading and management, text layout, typography
controls, internationalization support, and advanced text rendering features
with high-quality output and performance optimization.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
text analysis, intelligent layout optimization, and adaptive typography
capabilities without embedded AI processing.
