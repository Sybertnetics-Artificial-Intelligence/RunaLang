Note:
Runa Standard Library - 2D Graphics - UI Data Visualization and Charting System Module

This module provides sophisticated data visualization capabilities for creating
interactive charts, graphs, and statistical displays within user interfaces.
It includes comprehensive chart types (line, bar, pie, scatter, heatmaps,
candlestick), real-time data streaming support, multi-dimensional plotting,
and advanced statistical visualization with mathematical precision.

The rendering engine features hardware-accelerated graphics, smooth animations,
interactive zoom/pan controls, data point selection, tooltip systems, and
responsive layout adaptation. Data processing includes automatic scaling,
trend analysis, statistical aggregation, and performance optimization for
large datasets through data sampling and viewport culling techniques.

Architecture supports enterprise dashboard requirements with real-time data
binding, custom visualization plugins, export capabilities (PNG, SVG, PDF),
accessibility compliance for screen readers, and extensible theming for
consistent brand visualization across complex analytical interfaces.
