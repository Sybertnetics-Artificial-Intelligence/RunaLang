Note:
Runa Standard Library - 2D Graphics - UI Theming and Visual Style System Module

This module provides a sophisticated theming engine for comprehensive visual
style management across user interface components. It includes support for
material design principles, flat design aesthetics, custom theme architectures,
color palette management, typography systems, and dynamic visual adaptation
based on user preferences and environmental conditions.

The system features real-time theme switching with smooth transitions, automatic
contrast adjustment for accessibility compliance, CSS-in-Runa style definitions,
and cascading style inheritance through component hierarchies. Theme compilation
supports design token systems, semantic color mappings, responsive breakpoints,
and cross-platform style normalization.

Architecture enables enterprise-grade theming with brand customization,
white-label deployment support, user personalization engines, and theme
marketplace integration for scalable visual identity management.
