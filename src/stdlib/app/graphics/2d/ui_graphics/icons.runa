Note:
Runa Standard Library - 2D Graphics - UI Icon Management and Rendering System Module

This module provides comprehensive icon handling capabilities for modern user
interface design. It includes support for SVG vector graphics, bitmap formats
(PNG, JPEG, WebP), icon fonts, and procedural icon generation with multi-resolution
rendering, adaptive sizing, and cross-platform consistency. The system handles
icon libraries, asset optimization, and dynamic icon composition.

The rendering engine features high-quality anti-aliasing, sub-pixel positioning,
automatic DPI scaling, color theming integration, and performance optimization
through intelligent caching and batched rendering. Icon management includes
lazy loading, memory pooling, format transcoding, and progressive enhancement
for bandwidth-constrained environments.

Architecture supports enterprise icon systems with centralized asset management,
brand consistency enforcement, accessibility compliance (alt text, high contrast),
and extensible plugin systems for custom icon providers and rendering backends.
