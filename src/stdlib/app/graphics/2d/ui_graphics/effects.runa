Note:
Runa Standard Library - 2D Graphics - UI Visual Effects and Animation System Module

This module provides a comprehensive visual effects engine for enhancing user
interface graphics with sophisticated visual treatments and smooth animations.
It includes advanced effects processing (gaussian blur, drop shadows, glow,
gradients, reflections), transition systems, particle effects, and custom
shader-based effects with real-time performance optimization.

The rendering pipeline features GPU-accelerated effects processing, layered
compositing, alpha blending modes, filter stacks, and temporal effects management.
Animation systems include easing functions, keyframe interpolation, timeline
control, and physics-based motion with spring dynamics and momentum preservation
for natural feeling user interactions.

Architecture supports high-performance effects at 60fps with automatic quality
scaling, memory-efficient effect caching, batch processing optimization, and
extensible effect plugin systems for custom visual treatments across complex
interface hierarchies without compromising interactive responsiveness.
