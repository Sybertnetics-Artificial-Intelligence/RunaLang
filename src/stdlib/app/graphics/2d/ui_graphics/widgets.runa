Note:
Runa Standard Library - 2D Graphics - UI Widget System and Components Module

This module provides a comprehensive widget creation and management system for
building sophisticated interactive user interfaces. It includes foundational UI
components (buttons, inputs, containers, lists), advanced controls (sliders,
dropdowns, trees), layout management, and dynamic content rendering with
consistent styling and behavior patterns.

The system features high-performance rendering optimized for 60fps interactions,
comprehensive accessibility support with ARIA compliance, flexible theming
integration, and responsive layout capabilities. Widget state management includes
focus handling, event propagation, data binding, and animation coordination
across complex UI hierarchies.

Architecture supports scalability from simple forms to enterprise application
interfaces with modular component composition, custom widget development APIs,
and memory-efficient rendering pipelines for thousands of simultaneous widgets.
