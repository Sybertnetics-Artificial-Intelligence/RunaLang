OpenGL Core Profile Integration

This module provides the foundational OpenGL integration including:
- OpenGL context creation and management
- Core profile initialization (3.3+, 4.x)
- Version detection and capability querying
- State machine management
- Error handling and debugging
- Context sharing between threads
- Pixel format configuration
- Display list management (compatibility)
- Render target binding
- OpenGL object lifecycle management
