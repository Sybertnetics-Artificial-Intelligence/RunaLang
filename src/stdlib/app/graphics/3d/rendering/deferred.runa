Deferred Rendering Pipeline and G-Buffer Management

This module provides comprehensive deferred rendering including:
- G-buffer layout and management
- Geometry pass rendering
- Light accumulation and shading passes
- Screen-space lighting calculations
- Deferred transparency handling
- Tile-based deferred rendering
- G-buffer compression techniques
- Forward+ rendering hybrid approaches
- Multi-resolution rendering
- Bandwidth optimization strategies
