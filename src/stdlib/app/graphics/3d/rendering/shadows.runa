Shadow Rendering Techniques and Algorithms

This module provides comprehensive shadow rendering including:
- Shadow mapping with various filtering techniques
- Cascade shadow maps for large scenes
- Variance shadow mapping for soft shadows
- Shadow volumes and stencil shadows
- Screen-space shadows and contact shadows
- Volumetric shadows and light scattering
- Real-time ray-traced shadows
- Soft shadow approximations
- Shadow bias and peter-panning solutions
- Multi-light shadow optimization
- Shadow caching and temporal reuse
