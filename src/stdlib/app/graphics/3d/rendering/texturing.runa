Texture Mapping and Sampling Operations

This module provides comprehensive texture operations including:
- Texture sampling with various filtering methods
- UV coordinate mapping and transformation
- Mipmap generation and level selection
- Anisotropic filtering for texture quality
- Texture atlasing and packing operations
- Procedural texture generation
- Texture compression and decompression
- Multi-layer texture blending
- Texture streaming and memory management
- Cube mapping for environment textures
- Normal map and height map processing
