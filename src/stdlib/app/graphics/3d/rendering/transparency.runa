Transparency and Alpha Blending Operations

This module provides comprehensive transparency rendering including:
- Alpha blending with various blend modes
- Order-independent transparency techniques
- Depth peeling for accurate layering
- Weighted blended order-independent transparency
- Screen-space transparency effects
- Volumetric transparency and absorption
- Subsurface scattering for translucent materials
- Real-time refraction and caustics
- Alpha testing and coverage
- Temporal transparency effects
