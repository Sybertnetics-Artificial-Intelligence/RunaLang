Post-Processing Effects and Image Enhancement

This module provides comprehensive post-processing operations including:
- Bloom and glow effects
- Motion blur and depth of field
- Screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO)
- Temporal anti-aliasing (TAA)
- Color grading and tone mapping
- Film grain and vignetting effects
- Chromatic aberration simulation
- Screen-space reflections
- Edge detection and outline rendering
- Custom shader-based effects
