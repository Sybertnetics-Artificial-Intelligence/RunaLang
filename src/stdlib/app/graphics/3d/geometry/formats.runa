3D Model Format Loading, Saving, and Conversion

This module provides comprehensive 3D model format support including:
- Standard format loading (OBJ, FBX, GLTF, COLLADA, 3DS, PLY)
- CAD format support (STEP, IGES, STL for 3D printing)
- Game engine format support (Unity, Unreal, Godot formats)
- Animation and rigging data preservation
- Material and texture coordinate handling
- Mesh optimization during import/export
- Format conversion between different standards
- Batch processing for multiple files
- Streaming and progressive loading
- Format validation and error recovery
- Custom format definition and parsing
