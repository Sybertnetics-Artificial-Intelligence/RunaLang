System Theme Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive system theme integration for desktop applications.
Supports dark/light modes, accent colors, system preferences, and custom theming.

Core Functionality:
- Theme detection: system theme, dark/light mode, accent colors
- Theme application: apply system theme, custom themes, theme switching
- Color schemes: system colors, semantic colors, palette generation
- Visual effects: transparency, blur, animations per OS settings
- High contrast: accessibility themes, contrast detection
- Theme monitoring: change notifications, live updates
- Platform themes: Windows, macOS, Linux theme systems
- Custom themes: theme creation, import/export, sharing

Applications include adaptive UIs, accessibility-compliant apps, system-integrated tools,
and applications requiring seamless OS visual integration.
