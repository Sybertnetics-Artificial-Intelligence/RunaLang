File System Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive native file system integration for desktop applications.
Supports file associations, shell integration, file watchers, and system dialogs.

Core Functionality:
- File associations: register file types, default handlers, icons
- Shell integration: context menus, file properties, thumbnails
- File watching: monitor changes, directory watching, event notifications
- Special folders: desktop, documents, downloads, user directories
- File operations: native copy/move/delete with progress
- Metadata: extended attributes, file tags, comments
- Recent files: OS recent documents list integration
- File preview: Quick Look (macOS), preview handlers (Windows)

Applications include file managers, editors, media applications,
and any software requiring deep OS file system integration.
