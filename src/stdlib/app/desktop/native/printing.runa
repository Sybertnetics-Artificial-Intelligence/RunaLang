Printing and Print Management Module

This module provides comprehensive printing functionality for desktop applications.
Supports printer discovery, print jobs, page setup, and print preview capabilities.

Core Functionality:
- Printer discovery: list printers, default printer, printer capabilities
- Print setup: page layout, margins, orientation, paper size
- Print jobs: queue management, job status, cancellation
- Print preview: visual preview, page navigation, zoom
- Document printing: text, images, HTML, PDF generation
- Print options: copies, ranges, duplex, collation
- Printer settings: quality, color mode, media type
- Platform integration: native print dialogs and spoolers

Applications include document editors, reporting tools, web browsers,
and any application requiring hardcopy output capabilities.
