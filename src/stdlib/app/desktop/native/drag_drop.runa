Drag and Drop Operations Module

This module provides comprehensive drag and drop functionality for desktop applications.
Supports file dragging, data transfer, visual feedback, and cross-application operations.

Core Functionality:
- Drag sources: initiate drag, set drag data, drag images
- Drop targets: accept drops, validate data, handle drops
- Data transfer: text, files, images, custom formats
- Visual feedback: drag images, cursors, drop effects
- Drag events: dragstart, dragover, drop, dragend
- Cross-app drag: between applications, from/to OS
- Platform features: OS-specific drag behaviors
- Accessibility: keyboard alternatives, screen reader support

Applications include file managers, editors, design tools,
and any application requiring drag and drop interaction.
