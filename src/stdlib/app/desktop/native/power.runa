Power Management Module

This module provides comprehensive power management functionality for desktop applications.
Supports battery monitoring, power states, sleep prevention, and energy efficiency.

Core Functionality:
- Battery status: charge level, charging state, time remaining
- Power states: sleep, hibernate, shutdown, restart control
- Sleep prevention: keep awake, display sleep, system sleep
- Power plans: performance modes, power saving, balanced
- Thermal monitoring: CPU/GPU temperature, throttling detection
- Energy monitoring: power consumption, efficiency metrics
- Wake locks: prevent sleep during operations
- Platform integration: OS power management APIs

Applications include media players, backup tools, system utilities,
and any application requiring power state awareness or control.
