Accessibility Services Module

This module provides comprehensive accessibility support for desktop applications.
Supports screen readers, keyboard navigation, visual accommodations, and assistive technologies.

Core Functionality:
- Screen reader support: text-to-speech, descriptions, navigation
- Keyboard navigation: focus management, shortcuts, tab order
- Visual accommodations: zoom, high contrast, color filters
- Motor accommodations: sticky keys, slow keys, mouse alternatives
- Accessibility tree: semantic structure, roles, states
- Assistive technology APIs: platform accessibility bridges
- Testing tools: accessibility validation, WCAG compliance
- User preferences: system accessibility settings integration

Applications include accessible software, compliance tools, assistive applications,
and any software requiring full accessibility support.
