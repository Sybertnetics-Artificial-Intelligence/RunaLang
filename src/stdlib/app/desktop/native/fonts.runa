Font Management Module

This module provides comprehensive font management for desktop applications.
Supports system fonts, custom fonts, font metrics, and text rendering control.

Core Functionality:
- System fonts: enumerate fonts, font families, font properties
- Custom fonts: load fonts from file, embedded fonts, web fonts
- Font metrics: character measurements, line heights, kerning
- Font selection: font dialogs, font pickers, style selection
- Text rendering: anti-aliasing, hinting, subpixel rendering
- Font fallback: missing glyph handling, font substitution
- Font information: metadata, supported scripts, OpenType features
- Platform integration: OS font services, font caching

Applications include text editors, design tools, document processors,
and any application requiring advanced typography control.
