Core Functionality:
- Progress indication: progress bars, indeterminate state, paused state
- Jump lists: recent files, tasks, custom categories (Windows)
- Thumbnail toolbars: playback controls, custom buttons
- Overlay icons: status badges, notification counts
- Window grouping: app grouping, tab management
- Taskbar flash: attention requests, notifications
