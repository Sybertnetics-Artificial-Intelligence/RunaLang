Window Management Module

This module provides comprehensive window creation and management for desktop applications.
Supports window lifecycle, positioning, sizing, state management, and multi-window coordination.

Core Functionality:
- Window creation: main windows, child windows, modal windows, tool windows
- Window states: normal, minimized, maximized, fullscreen, hidden
- Position/Size: bounds management, centering, screen constraints, multi-monitor
- Window properties: title, icon, resizable, closable, focusable, always-on-top
- Event handling: close, resize, move, focus, blur, state changes
- Multi-window: parent-child relationships, window groups, z-order management
- Platform integration: native window handles, platform-specific features
- Performance: hardware acceleration, vsync, double buffering

Applications include desktop applications, tools, editors, media players,
and any software requiring native window management.
