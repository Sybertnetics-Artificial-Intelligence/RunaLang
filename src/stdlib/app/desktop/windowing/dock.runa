Dock Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive dock integration for macOS and Linux desktop environments.
Supports dock badges, progress indicators, bounce animations, and dock menus.

Core Functionality:
- Dock badges: text badges, numeric badges, custom icons
- Progress indication: progress bars on dock icon
- Bounce animations: attention requests, critical alerts
- Dock menus: custom right-click menus, recent items
- Icon overlays: status indicators, custom overlays
- Unity launcher: Ubuntu Unity quicklists and counters
- Application grouping: window management from dock
- Platform abstraction: unified API for macOS Dock and Linux docks

Applications include download managers, messaging apps, productivity tools,
and any application requiring dock presence and interaction.
