Window Decorations Module

This module provides comprehensive window decoration and theming functionality.
Supports title bars, borders, custom chrome, and platform-specific decorations.

Core Functionality:
- Title bar: custom title bars, integrated controls, color/style
- Window borders: frame styles, resize handles, shadows
- Custom chrome: frameless windows, custom drawn decorations
- Control buttons: minimize/maximize/close customization
- Theme integration: system theme matching, dark/light modes
- Transparency effects: blur, acrylic, vibrancy effects
- Platform styles: native look per OS, custom styling
- Client-side decorations: GTK/Qt CSD support

Applications include custom-styled applications, media players, tools,
and applications requiring branded or unique window appearance.
