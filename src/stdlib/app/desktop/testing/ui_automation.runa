UI Automation Testing Module

This module provides comprehensive UI automation testing for desktop applications.
Supports element interaction, test recording, verification, and cross-platform automation.

Core Functionality:
- Element location: find by id, class, text, xpath, accessibility
- Element interaction: click, type, drag, hover, focus
- Test recording: action recording, playback, script generation
- Verification: state checking, content validation, visual testing
- Synchronization: waits, polling, condition checking
- Window control: window manipulation, dialog handling
- Screenshot capture: element shots, full window, regions
- Test reporting: results, logs, screenshots, videos

Applications include automated testing, regression testing, UI validation,
and continuous integration testing for desktop applications.
