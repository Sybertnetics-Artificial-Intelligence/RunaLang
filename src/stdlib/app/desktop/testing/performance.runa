Desktop Performance Testing Module

This module provides comprehensive performance testing for desktop applications.
Supports CPU/memory profiling, rendering performance, startup time, and resource usage analysis.

Core Functionality:
- CPU profiling: usage monitoring, hotspot detection, thread analysis
- Memory profiling: heap analysis, leak detection, allocation tracking
- Rendering performance: FPS monitoring, frame drops, GPU usage
- Startup performance: cold/warm start, initialization timing
- I/O performance: disk usage, network activity, file operations
- Resource monitoring: handles, threads, processes, system impact
- Load testing: stress testing, concurrent users, scalability
- Performance regression: baseline comparison, trend analysis

Applications include performance optimization, bottleneck identification, resource management,
and ensuring desktop applications meet performance requirements.
