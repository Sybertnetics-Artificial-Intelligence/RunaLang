System Integration Testing Module

This module provides comprehensive system integration testing for desktop applications.
Supports OS service integration, external tool testing, workflow validation, and end-to-end scenarios.

Core Functionality:
- OS service integration: file system, clipboard, printing, notifications
- External tool integration: databases, web services, command-line tools
- Workflow testing: multi-step processes, user journeys, business scenarios
- Data flow validation: input/output, transformations, persistence
- Inter-process communication: pipes, sockets, shared memory
- Service dependency testing: network services, system services
- Configuration testing: settings, preferences, environment variables
- Error handling: failure scenarios, recovery mechanisms, rollbacks

Applications include integration validation, system testing, deployment verification,
and ensuring seamless interaction between application components and system services.
