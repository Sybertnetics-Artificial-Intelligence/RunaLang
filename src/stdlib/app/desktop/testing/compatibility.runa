OS Compatibility Testing Module

This module provides comprehensive OS compatibility testing for desktop applications.
Supports multi-platform validation, version testing, feature detection, and environment verification.

Core Functionality:
- OS version testing: Windows 10/11, macOS versions, Linux distributions
- Architecture testing: x86, x64, ARM compatibility validation
- Feature detection: API availability, capability checking
- Environment validation: dependencies, runtime requirements
- Hardware compatibility: GPU, display, input device testing
- Localization testing: language, region, character encoding
- Permission testing: security contexts, privilege levels
- Migration testing: data compatibility, settings transfer

Applications include cross-platform validation, deployment verification, compatibility assurance,
and ensuring applications work across diverse desktop environments.
