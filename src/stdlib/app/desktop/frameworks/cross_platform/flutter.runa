Flutter Desktop Integration Module for Cross-Platform Applications

This module provides Flutter framework integration for building native desktop
applications from a single codebase. Enables creation of beautiful, natively
compiled applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux using Dart and Flutter.

Key Features:
- Single codebase for all platforms
- Native performance with AOT compilation
- Rich widget library
- Hot reload for development
- Material and Cupertino design
- Custom painting and effects
- Platform channels for native code
- Desktop-specific widgets
- Window management
- File system access
- Native menus and system tray
- Keyboard and mouse support

Provides Flutter engine bridge and platform channel integration for building
modern desktop applications with Flutter's reactive framework.
