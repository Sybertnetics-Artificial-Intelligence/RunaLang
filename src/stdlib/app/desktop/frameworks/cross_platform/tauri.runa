Note:
Tauri Framework Integration Module for Lightweight Web-Based Desktop Applications

This module provides Tauri framework integration for building secure, lightweight desktop
applications using web technologies with a Rust backend. Offers smaller bundle sizes
and better performance than Electron while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

Key Features:
- Rust backend with web frontend
- Small bundle size (< 10MB)
- Secure by default architecture
- Custom protocol handlers
- Native system integration
- Window management
- IPC between frontend and backend
- File system access with permissions
- System tray support
- Auto-updater
- Code signing support
- Native notifications

Provides Tauri API bridge for building modern, secure desktop applications
with minimal resource usage.
