Electron Framework Integration Module for Web-Based Desktop Applications

This module provides Electron framework integration for building cross-platform desktop
applications using web technologies. Enables creation of desktop apps with HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript while accessing native OS capabilities through Electron's APIs.

Key Features:
- Main and renderer process management
- BrowserWindow creation and control
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
- Native menus and system tray
- File system access
- Native notifications
- Auto-updater support
- Protocol handling
- Global shortcuts
- Screen and display management
- Power monitor and save
- Crash reporting

Provides Electron API bridge for building modern desktop applications using
web technologies with full native system access.
