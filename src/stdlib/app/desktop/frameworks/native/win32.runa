Win32 API Integration Module for Desktop Applications

This module provides comprehensive Win32 API integration for native Windows desktop applications.
Implements window management, message handling, GDI+ graphics, and system integration for
Windows desktop development. Essential for creating native Windows applications with full
OS integration and performance.

Key Features:
- Window creation and management (HWND handling)
- Message pump and event processing
- GDI/GDI+ graphics integration
- Common controls and dialogs
- Shell integration and taskbar features
- Registry access and COM interop
- DPI awareness and multi-monitor support
- Windows themes and visual styles
- Clipboard and drag-drop operations
- System tray and notifications
- Direct2D/DirectWrite integration
- Windows Runtime (WinRT) bridge

Provides low-level Win32 API access wrapped in safe Runa interfaces for building
high-performance native Windows applications with complete system integration.
