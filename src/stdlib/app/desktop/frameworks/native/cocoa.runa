Cocoa Framework Integration Module for macOS Desktop Applications

This module provides comprehensive Cocoa framework integration for native macOS applications.
Implements NSWindow, NSView, AppKit components, and macOS system integration for desktop
development. Essential for creating native macOS applications with full OS integration
and native look and feel.

Key Features:
- NSApplication and delegate management
- NSWindow creation and management
- NSView hierarchy and custom views
- AppKit controls and components
- Core Graphics and Core Animation
- NSMenu and dock integration
- NSNotificationCenter integration
- Touch Bar support
- Dark mode and appearance management
- iCloud and Handoff integration
- Sandbox and security features
- Metal rendering support

Provides Objective-C runtime bridge and AppKit wrappers for building native macOS
applications with complete system integration and Apple ecosystem features.
