Note:
FLTK (Fast Light Toolkit) Integration Module for Lightweight Desktop Applications

This module provides FLTK integration for creating lightweight, fast desktop applications.
FLTK is known for its small size, speed, and static linking capabilities, making it ideal
for embedded systems and applications requiring minimal dependencies.

Key Features:
- Lightweight window and widget system
- Built-in drawing primitives
- Native look on all platforms
- Static linking support
- Minimal dependencies
- Fast rendering
- Built-in image support
- OpenGL integration
- Fluid UI designer support
- Scheme-based theming
- UTF-8 support
- Minimal memory footprint

Provides FLTK C++ API bridge for building fast, lightweight desktop applications
with minimal system requirements.
