Note:
GTK Framework Integration Module for Linux Desktop Applications

This module provides comprehensive GTK (GIMP Toolkit) integration for native Linux desktop
applications. Implements GTK widgets, signals, and GNOME desktop integration for creating
native Linux applications with modern UI capabilities and desktop environment integration.

Key Features:
- GTK application and window management
- Complete widget hierarchy support
- Signal and callback system
- Cairo graphics integration
- GLib main loop integration
- DBus communication support
- GNOME desktop integration
- GTK themes and styling (CSS)
- GtkBuilder and Glade support
- Drag and drop operations
- System tray and notifications
- HiDPI and multi-monitor support

Provides GObject introspection bridge and GTK wrappers for building native Linux
desktop applications with full desktop environment integration.
