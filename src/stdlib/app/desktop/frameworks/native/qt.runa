Qt Framework Integration Module for Cross-Platform Desktop Applications

This module provides comprehensive Qt framework integration for cross-platform desktop
applications. Implements QWidget hierarchy, signals/slots, and Qt's extensive toolkit
for creating native-looking applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux with a single codebase.

Key Features:
- QApplication and event loop management
- QWidget and QML integration
- Signals and slots mechanism
- Qt Designer UI file support
- Model/View architecture
- Graphics View framework
- Qt Quick and QML support
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Network and database modules
- WebEngine integration
- Multimedia support
- Platform-specific features

Provides Qt meta-object system bridge and comprehensive widget wrappers for building
professional cross-platform desktop applications.
