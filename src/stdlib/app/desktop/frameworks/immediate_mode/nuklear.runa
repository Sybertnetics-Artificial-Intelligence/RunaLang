Note:
Nuklear Integration Module for Minimal Immediate Mode GUI

This module provides Nuklear integration for creating minimal, embeddable immediate
mode GUIs. Nuklear is a single-header ANSI C library with minimal dependencies,
perfect for embedded systems and applications requiring tiny GUI footprint.

Key Features:
- Single-header library
- Minimal dependencies
- ANSI C implementation
- Tiny memory footprint
- No global state
- Customizable rendering
- UTF-8 support
- Vertex buffer output
- Skinnable interface
- Zero allocation mode
- Embedded systems ready
- Custom memory management

Provides Nuklear C API bridge for building immediate mode interfaces
with minimal resource requirements.
