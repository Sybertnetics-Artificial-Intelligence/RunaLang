Note:
Dear ImGui Integration Module for Immediate Mode GUI

This module provides Dear ImGui integration for creating immediate mode graphical
user interfaces. Perfect for tools, debug UIs, and applications requiring dynamic
interfaces without retained state. Widely used in game development and tools.

Key Features:
- Immediate mode paradigm
- No retained state required
- Excellent for tools and debug UIs
- Docking and viewport support
- Rich widget collection
- Plotting and graphing
- Tables and columns
- Custom rendering backend
- Keyboard and gamepad navigation
- Drag and drop support
- Style editor
- Performance focused

Provides Dear ImGui C++ API bridge for building immediate mode interfaces
with minimal overhead and maximum flexibility.
