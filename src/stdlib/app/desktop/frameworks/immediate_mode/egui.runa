Note:
egui Integration Module for Immediate Mode GUI in Rust

This module provides egui integration for creating immediate mode GUIs with a
Rust-native implementation. Offers pure Rust immediate mode GUI with excellent
performance and web support through WebAssembly.

Key Features:
- Pure Rust implementation
- Immediate mode architecture
- WebAssembly support
- Responsive layouts
- Accessibility support
- Theme customization
- Retained mode helpers
- Context menus
- Drag and drop
- Rich text support
- Plot widgets
- Memory efficient

Provides egui Rust API bridge for building immediate mode interfaces
with Rust's safety guarantees and performance.
