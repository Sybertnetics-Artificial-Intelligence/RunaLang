Note:
Mobile Performance Testing Module

This module provides comprehensive performance testing framework for mobile applications.
Implements load testing, stress testing, memory profiling, battery usage analysis,
and performance benchmarking with mobile-specific metrics and optimizations.

Key Features:
- Load and stress testing
- Memory usage profiling
- CPU performance monitoring
- Battery consumption analysis
- Network performance testing
- UI responsiveness measurement
- App startup time testing
- Frame rate and rendering analysis
- Background task performance
- Database query optimization testing
- Image and asset loading performance
- Cross-device performance comparison
- Performance regression detection
- Real-device performance testing
- Automated performance reporting

Provides complete performance testing system for building mobile applications
with optimal performance characteristics and user experience.
