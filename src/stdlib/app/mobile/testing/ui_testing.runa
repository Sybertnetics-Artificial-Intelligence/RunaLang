Note:
UI Testing Module for Mobile Applications

This module provides comprehensive UI testing framework for mobile applications.
Implements UI element interaction, screen navigation testing, gesture simulation,
and visual regression testing with platform-specific automation tools.

Key Features:
- UI element identification and interaction
- Screen navigation and flow testing
- Gesture and touch simulation
- Text input and validation
- Visual regression testing
- Screenshot comparison
- Accessibility testing integration
- Cross-device UI testing
- Test recording and playback
- Page object model support
- Test synchronization and waits
- Device orientation testing
- Multi-language UI testing
- Performance UI testing
- Continuous UI test execution

Provides complete UI testing system for building mobile applications
with comprehensive user interface validation and automation.
