Note:
Mobile Accessibility Testing Module

This module provides comprehensive accessibility testing framework for mobile applications.
Implements accessibility compliance testing, assistive technology validation,
and inclusive design verification with platform-specific accessibility standards.

Key Features:
- Accessibility compliance testing (WCAG, ADA)
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Voice control functionality testing
- High contrast and color blindness testing
- Font size and scaling testing
- Touch target size validation
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Focus management testing
- Alternative text validation
- Semantic markup verification
- Assistive technology integration
- Accessibility gesture testing
- Audio description testing
- Caption and subtitle testing
- Inclusive design validation

Provides complete accessibility testing system for building mobile applications
with universal accessibility and inclusive user experience.
