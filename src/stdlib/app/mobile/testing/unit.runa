Note:
Mobile Unit Testing Module

This module provides comprehensive unit testing framework for mobile applications.
Implements test case management, assertion libraries, mocking frameworks,
and test execution with mobile-specific optimizations and cross-platform support.

Key Features:
- Unit test case creation and management
- Assertion and verification libraries
- Mock object generation and injection
- Test fixture setup and teardown
- Parameterized testing support
- Test discovery and execution
- Code coverage measurement
- Test result reporting
- Async and concurrent test support
- Performance test benchmarking
- Test categorization and tagging
- Test dependency management
- Cross-platform test compatibility
- Test data generation utilities
- Continuous integration support

Provides complete unit testing system for building mobile applications
with robust test coverage and quality assurance.
