Note:
Mobile Network Condition Testing Module

This module provides comprehensive network condition testing framework for mobile applications.
Implements network simulation, connectivity testing, bandwidth analysis,
and network resilience testing with mobile-specific network scenarios.

Key Features:
- Network condition simulation (3G, 4G, 5G, WiFi)
- Connection stability testing
- Bandwidth and latency analysis
- Network interruption handling
- Offline mode testing
- Data usage optimization testing
- Network timeout behavior
- Background sync testing
- Network quality metrics
- Roaming scenario testing
- Network switching behavior
- Poor connectivity handling
- Network error recovery testing
- Data compression efficiency
- Network security testing

Provides complete network testing system for building mobile applications
with robust network handling and optimized connectivity experience.
