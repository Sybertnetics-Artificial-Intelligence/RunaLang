Note:
Device Testing Module for Mobile Applications

This module provides comprehensive device testing framework for mobile applications.
Implements cross-device compatibility testing, hardware feature validation,
sensor testing, and device-specific behavior verification across platforms.

Key Features:
- Cross-device compatibility testing
- Hardware feature availability testing
- Sensor functionality validation
- Screen resolution and density testing
- Camera and media device testing
- GPS and location service testing
- Accelerometer and gyroscope testing
- Battery and power management testing
- Network connectivity testing
- Bluetooth and NFC testing
- Device orientation testing
- Touch and gesture capability testing
- Audio input/output testing
- Storage and file system testing
- Device-specific performance validation

Provides complete device testing system for building mobile applications
with comprehensive hardware compatibility and feature validation.
