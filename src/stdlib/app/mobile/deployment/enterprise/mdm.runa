Note:
Mobile Device Management (MDM) Module

This module provides comprehensive Mobile Device Management integration for enterprise applications.
Implements device enrollment, policy enforcement, app distribution,
and device management with major MDM platforms and enterprise solutions.

Key Features:
- Device enrollment and registration
- Policy enforcement and compliance
- App distribution and management
- Remote device configuration
- Security policy implementation
- Device compliance monitoring
- Remote wipe and lock capabilities
- Certificate and VPN management
- App wrapping and containerization
- User and group management
- Audit logging and reporting
- Integration with major MDM platforms
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) support
- Kiosk mode configuration
- Enterprise app store integration

Provides complete MDM integration system for building mobile applications
with enterprise-grade device management and security controls.
