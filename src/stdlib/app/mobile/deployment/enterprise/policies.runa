Note:
Enterprise Device Policies Module

This module provides comprehensive enterprise device policy management for mobile applications.
Implements policy creation, enforcement, compliance monitoring, and restriction management
for enterprise mobile device management and security control.

Key Features:
- Device policy creation and management
- Security policy enforcement
- App installation and usage restrictions
- Network access control policies
- Data encryption and protection policies
- User behavior and usage policies
- Device configuration policies
- Compliance monitoring and reporting
- Policy violation detection and response
- Granular permission management
- Group-based policy assignment
- Policy inheritance and overrides
- Real-time policy enforcement
- Policy audit trails and logging
- Cross-platform policy support

Provides complete enterprise policy system for building mobile applications
with comprehensive device management and security control capabilities.
