Beta Testing Distribution Module

This module provides comprehensive beta testing distribution system for mobile applications.
Implements beta user management, build distribution, feedback collection,
and beta testing workflow management with platform-specific beta programs.

Key Features:
- Beta tester enrollment and management
- Beta build distribution and deployment
- TestFlight and Google Play internal testing integration
- Beta feedback collection and management
- Crash reporting and analytics for beta builds
- Beta testing group management
- Build versioning and release notes
- Beta access control and permissions
- Automated beta deployment workflows
- Beta testing metrics and analytics
- Beta user communication and notifications
- Beta build expiration management
- Staged beta rollout capabilities
- Beta to production promotion workflows
- Cross-platform beta testing support

Provides complete beta testing system for building mobile applications
with comprehensive beta user management and testing workflows.
