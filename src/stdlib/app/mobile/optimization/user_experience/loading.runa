Mobile Loading Time Optimization Module

This module provides comprehensive loading time optimization for mobile applications.
Implements loading state management, skeleton screens, progressive loading,
and perceived performance optimization with mobile-specific loading strategies.

Key Features:
- Loading state management and optimization
- Skeleton screens and placeholder content
- Progressive loading and streaming
- Perceived performance optimization
- Loading animation and feedback optimization
- Critical resource prioritization
- Above-the-fold content optimization
- Loading time measurement and analysis
- Adaptive loading based on connection speed
- Background loading and prefetching
- Loading error handling and recovery
- Loading progress indication
- Lazy loading implementation
- Loading performance analytics
- Cross-platform loading optimization

Provides complete loading optimization system for building mobile applications
with fast perceived loading times and optimal user experience.
