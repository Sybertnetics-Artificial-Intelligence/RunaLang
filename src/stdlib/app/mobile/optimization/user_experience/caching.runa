Note:
Mobile Intelligent Caching Strategies Module

This module provides comprehensive intelligent caching strategies for mobile applications.
Implements multi-level caching, cache optimization, invalidation strategies,
and adaptive caching with mobile-specific storage and memory constraints.

Key Features:
- Multi-level caching architecture (memory, disk, network)
- Intelligent cache replacement algorithms
- Adaptive caching based on usage patterns
- Cache invalidation and expiration strategies
- Cache warming and preloading
- Cache compression and optimization
- Cache synchronization across devices
- Cache analytics and monitoring
- Context-aware caching strategies
- Battery-efficient caching
- Cache size management and limits
- Cache hit ratio optimization
- Cross-platform caching solutions
- Cache security and encryption
- Cache performance optimization

Provides complete intelligent caching system for building mobile applications
with optimized data access and reduced network usage.
