Note:
Mobile Asset Bundling and Lazy Loading Module

This module provides comprehensive asset bundling and lazy loading for mobile applications.
Implements intelligent asset bundling, on-demand loading, progressive loading strategies,
and dynamic resource management with mobile-specific loading optimization.

Key Features:
- Intelligent asset bundling strategies
- Lazy loading and on-demand resource loading
- Progressive asset loading and streaming
- Dynamic bundle creation and management
- Asset dependency analysis and optimization
- Bundle splitting and chunking strategies
- Preloading and prefetching optimization
- Cache-aware bundling strategies
- Platform-specific bundle optimization
- Bundle compression and optimization
- Asset loading prioritization
- Bundle versioning and updates
- Loading performance optimization
- Cross-platform bundle management
- Bundle loading analytics

Provides complete bundling and loading system for building mobile applications
with optimized asset delivery and efficient resource utilization.
