Note:
Mobile Resources Optimization Module

This module provides comprehensive resource optimization for mobile applications.
Implements resource compression, localization optimization, configuration optimization,
and resource management with mobile-specific size constraints and loading efficiency.

Key Features:
- Resource file compression and optimization
- Localization resource optimization
- Configuration file optimization
- Font and typography resource optimization
- Shader and graphics resource optimization
- String resource deduplication
- Resource versioning and caching
- Platform-specific resource optimization
- Resource loading prioritization
- Unused resource detection and removal
- Resource bundling and packaging
- Dynamic resource loading
- Resource quality scaling
- Cross-platform resource management
- Resource optimization analytics

Provides complete resource optimization system for building mobile applications
with efficient resource usage and minimal storage impact.
