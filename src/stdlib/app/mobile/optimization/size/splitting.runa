Note:
Mobile App Bundle Splitting Module

This module provides comprehensive app bundle splitting for mobile applications.
Implements dynamic feature modules, on-demand delivery, conditional downloads,
and modular architecture with platform-specific bundle splitting strategies.

Key Features:
- Dynamic feature module creation
- On-demand feature delivery and installation
- Conditional feature downloading
- Modular app architecture optimization
- Bundle splitting strategies and policies
- Feature dependency management
- Install-time and runtime feature delivery
- Geographic and device-specific splitting
- Language and localization splitting
- A/B testing with feature modules
- Feature usage analytics and optimization
- Bundle size optimization and management
- Cross-platform splitting support
- Feature rollback and versioning
- Splitting performance optimization

Provides complete app splitting system for building mobile applications
with modular architecture and optimized download sizes.
