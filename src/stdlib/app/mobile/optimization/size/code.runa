Note:
Mobile Code Size Reduction Module

This module provides comprehensive code size reduction and obfuscation for mobile applications.
Implements code minification, dead code elimination, obfuscation, and compilation optimization
with mobile-specific size constraints and performance preservation strategies.

Key Features:
- Code minification and compression
- Dead code elimination and tree shaking
- Code obfuscation and protection
- Unused import and dependency removal
- Code splitting and modularization
- Compilation optimization flags
- Symbol renaming and shortening
- Code deduplication and sharing
- Library and framework optimization
- Bytecode optimization and compression
- Platform-specific code optimization
- Conditional compilation optimization
- Code analysis and size profiling
- Cross-platform code optimization
- Code size impact analysis

Provides complete code optimization system for building mobile applications
with minimal executable size and preserved functionality.
