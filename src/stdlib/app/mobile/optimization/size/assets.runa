Implements image compression, audio optimization, video compression, and asset management
with mobile-specific size constraints and quality balance optimization.

Key Features:
- Image compression and format optimization
- Audio asset compression and optimization
- Video asset compression and transcoding
- Asset bundling and packaging
- Progressive asset loading
- Asset caching and storage optimization
- Lossless and lossy compression strategies
- Platform-specific asset optimization
- Asset quality scaling and adaptation
- Unused asset detection and removal
- Asset preprocessing and optimization
- Dynamic asset loading and unloading
- Asset compression ratio analysis
- Cross-platform asset management
- Asset optimization reporting

Provides complete asset optimization system for building mobile applications
with minimal size impact and optimal quality preservation.
