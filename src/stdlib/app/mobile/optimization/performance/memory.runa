Note:
Mobile Memory Optimization Module

This module provides comprehensive memory optimization and management for mobile applications.
Implements memory profiling, leak detection, allocation optimization, and memory-efficient
data structures with mobile-specific memory constraints and optimization strategies.

Key Features:
- Memory usage profiling and monitoring
- Memory leak detection and prevention
- Allocation pattern optimization
- Garbage collection optimization
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Object pooling and reuse strategies
- Memory pressure handling
- Low memory warning management
- Cache-friendly memory layouts
- Memory mapping optimization
- Reference counting and weak references
- Memory fragmentation reduction
- Background memory cleanup
- Memory usage analytics and reporting
- Cross-platform memory management

Provides complete memory optimization system for building mobile applications
with efficient memory usage and optimal performance characteristics.
