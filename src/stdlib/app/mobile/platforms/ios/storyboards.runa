Note:
iOS Storyboard Management and Interface Builder Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive iOS storyboard management including Interface Builder
integration, scene management, segue handling, prototype cell configuration, and
runtime storyboard manipulation. Essential for building iOS applications with visual
interface design and maintaining proper storyboard architecture following Apple's patterns.

Key Features:
- Complete storyboard loading and instantiation management
- Interface Builder integration with IBOutlet and IBAction support
- Scene and view controller instantiation from storyboards
- Segue configuration and runtime manipulation
- Prototype table view and collection view cell management
- Storyboard reference handling and modular design
- Auto Layout constraint management within storyboards
- Localization support for storyboard resources
- Runtime storyboard modification and dynamic scene creation
- Adaptive layout configuration for different device sizes

Implements iOS SDK patterns including NSCoder protocol compliance,
Interface Builder integration, storyboard segue patterns, and proper
memory management for production iOS storyboard-based applications.
