Note:
Xcode Project Generation and Build Configuration Module

This module provides comprehensive Xcode project management including project file
generation, target configuration, build settings management, scheme creation, and
workspace organization. Essential for iOS application development and build automation
following Apple's Xcode project structure and build system requirements.

Key Features:
- Complete Xcode project (.xcodeproj) generation and management
- Target configuration and dependency management
- Build settings and configuration management
- Scheme creation and automation support
- Workspace and project organization
- Source file and resource management
- Framework and library integration
- Build phase configuration and scripting
- Provisioning profile and code signing integration
- Archive and distribution configuration

Implements Xcode project format specifications including PBXProject structure,
build configuration management, target dependency resolution, and proper
project organization for production iOS application development.
