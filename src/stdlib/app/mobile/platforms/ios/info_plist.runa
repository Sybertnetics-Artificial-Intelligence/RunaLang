Note:
iOS Info.plist Configuration and Metadata Management Module

This module provides comprehensive iOS Info.plist management including application
metadata configuration, capability declarations, URL scheme registration, permission
usage descriptions, and runtime property list manipulation. Essential for proper
iOS application configuration and App Store compliance following Apple's requirements.

Key Features:
- Complete Info.plist structure management and validation
- Application metadata and identifier configuration
- URL scheme and Universal Link configuration
- Privacy usage description management
- Capability and entitlement declaration
- Localization and internationalization support
- Background mode and execution configuration
- Custom property and extension point management
- App Transport Security configuration
- Runtime Info.plist modification and querying

Implements iOS SDK patterns including NSBundle property list access,
CFBundle key management, application configuration patterns, and proper
metadata handling for production iOS applications.
