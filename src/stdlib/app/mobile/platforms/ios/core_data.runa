Note:
iOS Core Data Stack and Persistent Storage Management Module

This module provides comprehensive Core Data integration including managed object
context management, persistent store coordination, data model configuration, migration
handling, and performance optimization. Essential for building iOS applications with
robust local data persistence following Apple's Core Data best practices.

Key Features:
- Complete Core Data stack setup and configuration
- Managed object model loading and validation
- Persistent store coordinator and container management
- Managed object context creation and management
- Core Data migration and versioning support
- Batch processing and performance optimization
- Relationship management and cascade rules
- Fetch request construction and optimization
- Core Data concurrency and threading support
- CloudKit integration for sync capabilities

Implements iOS SDK patterns including NSManagedObject subclassing,
NSFetchedResultsController integration, Core Data migration patterns,
and proper memory management for production Core Data applications.
