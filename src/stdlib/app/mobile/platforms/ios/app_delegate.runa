Note:
iOS App Delegate Lifecycle and Application Management Module

This module provides comprehensive iOS application lifecycle management through the
UIApplicationDelegate protocol implementation, including launch handling, state
transitions, background processing, push notifications, and system integration.
Essential for managing the complete iOS application lifecycle following Apple's patterns.

Key Features:
- Complete application lifecycle event handling (launch, terminate, background)
- State preservation and restoration support
- Push notification registration and handling
- URL scheme and Universal Link processing
- Background processing and task management
- Scene-based architecture support for iOS 13+
- Application settings and configuration management
- Memory warning and low storage handling
- Handoff and Continuity integration
- System service integration (Siri, Shortcuts, etc.)

Implements iOS SDK patterns including UIApplicationDelegate protocol,
state restoration, background task management, and proper application
lifecycle handling for production iOS applications.
