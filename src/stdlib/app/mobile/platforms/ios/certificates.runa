Note:
iOS Code Signing and Certificate Management Module

This module provides comprehensive iOS code signing and certificate management including
provisioning profile handling, certificate validation, keychain integration, code
signing identity management, and App Store distribution preparation. Essential for
iOS application deployment and distribution following Apple's security requirements.

Key Features:
- Complete code signing certificate management
- Provisioning profile creation and validation
- Keychain integration and certificate storage
- Code signing identity resolution and selection
- Developer and distribution certificate handling
- App Store Connect API integration
- Certificate expiration monitoring and renewal
- Team and developer account management
- Entitlements and capability validation
- Automated code signing workflow support

Implements iOS SDK patterns including Security framework integration,
Keychain Services API usage, codesign tool integration, and proper
certificate lifecycle management for production iOS applications.
