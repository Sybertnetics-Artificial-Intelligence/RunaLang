Note:
iOS View Controller Lifecycle and Management Module

This module provides comprehensive iOS view controller management including lifecycle
handling, navigation control, view hierarchy management, transition animations,
and memory management. Essential for building robust iOS applications with proper
MVC architecture and user interface management following Apple's design patterns.

Key Features:
- Complete view controller lifecycle methods (viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear, etc.)
- Navigation controller and tab bar controller management
- Modal presentation and dismissal with custom transitions
- Container view controllers and child controller management
- View hierarchy management and auto layout integration
- Memory management and view controller cleanup
- Storyboard and XIB integration support
- Adaptive UI for different screen sizes and orientations
- Custom view controller transitions and animations
- Accessibility and VoiceOver integration

Implements iOS SDK patterns including UIViewController inheritance,
delegation patterns, target-action paradigm, and proper memory
management for production iOS application development.
