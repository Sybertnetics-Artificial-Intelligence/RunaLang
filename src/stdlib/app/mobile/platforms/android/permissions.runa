Note:
Android Permission System Management Module

This module provides comprehensive Android permission management including runtime
permissions, manifest permissions, permission groups, custom permissions, and
security policy enforcement. Essential for handling sensitive device features,
user data access, and maintaining app security compliance.

Key Features:
- Runtime permission requests and handling (Android 6+)
- Manifest permission declaration and validation
- Permission group management and rationale display
- Custom permission definition and enforcement
- Special permissions (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW, WRITE_SETTINGS, etc.)
- Permission state monitoring and change detection
- Dangerous permission categorization and flow
- Background permission handling (location, microphone, etc.)
- Permission delegation and temporary grants
- Security policy compliance checking

Implements Android SDK patterns including ActivityCompat permission APIs,
permission result callbacks, rationale dialogs, and proper UX flows
for production Android permission management.
