Note:
Android Intent System and App Communication Module

This module provides comprehensive Android intent management including explicit intents,
implicit intents, intent filters, broadcast intents, pending intents, and inter-app
communication. Essential for activity launching, service starting, broadcast messaging,
and deep linking in Android applications.

Key Features:
- Intent creation and configuration (action, data, extras, categories)
- Explicit intents for direct component targeting
- Implicit intents for system and third-party app integration
- Intent filter registration and matching
- Broadcast intent sending and receiving
- Pending intent creation for delayed execution
- Deep linking and app link handling
- Intent resolution and component discovery
- Data URI construction and parsing
- MIME type handling and content resolution

Implements Android SDK patterns including Intent class usage,
BroadcastReceiver integration, intent-filter matching algorithms,
and proper security considerations for production Android apps.
