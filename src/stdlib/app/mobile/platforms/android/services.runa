Note:
Android Service Management and Background Task Processing Module

This module provides comprehensive Android service management including foreground
services, background services, bound services, intent services, and job scheduling.
Essential for handling long-running operations, background processing, IPC communication,
and system-level service integration in Android applications.

Key Features:
- Service lifecycle management (onCreate, onStartCommand, onDestroy)
- Foreground service with notification support
- Bound service with IPC capabilities
- IntentService for background task queuing
- JobScheduler and WorkManager integration
- Service binding and unbinding operations
- Notification management for foreground services
- Background processing limitations handling (Android 8+)
- Service discovery and inter-process communication
- System service access and permissions

Implements Android SDK patterns including Service class inheritance,
IBinder implementation, notification channels, work constraints,
and proper resource management for production Android services.
