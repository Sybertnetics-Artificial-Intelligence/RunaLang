Note:
Android Activity Lifecycle and Management Module

This module provides comprehensive Android activity management capabilities including
lifecycle handling, state preservation, intent processing, fragment management,
navigation flow control, and UI thread operations. Essential for building robust
Android applications with proper activity management and user experience.

Key Features:
- Complete activity lifecycle methods (onCreate, onStart, onResume, etc.)
- State saving and restoration (savedInstanceState handling)
- Intent creation and processing with extras and data URIs
- Fragment transactions and back stack management
- Task and back stack navigation control
- Configuration change handling (rotation, language, etc.)
- Activity result handling and permission requests
- Window and action bar management
- Transition animations and shared element transitions
- Multi-window and picture-in-picture support

Implements Android SDK patterns including AppCompatActivity inheritance,
lifecycle-aware components, ViewModel integration, and proper resource
management for production-ready Android application development.
