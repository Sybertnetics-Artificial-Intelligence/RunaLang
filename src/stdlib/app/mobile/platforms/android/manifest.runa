Note:
Android Manifest Generation and Configuration Module

This module provides comprehensive Android manifest file generation, validation,
and configuration management including application components, permissions,
intent filters, metadata, and build configurations. Essential for proper
Android app packaging, security declarations, and system integration.

Key Features:
- Complete AndroidManifest.xml generation and validation
- Application component declarations (activities, services, receivers)
- Permission declarations and usage requirements
- Intent filter configuration and validation
- Metadata and configuration parameters
- Feature requirements and hardware declarations
- Application theme and configuration management
- Backup and restore configuration
- Network security configuration
- App bundle and signing configuration

Implements Android SDK standards including manifest schema validation,
component lifecycle declarations, security policy enforcement,
and proper metadata management for production Android applications.
