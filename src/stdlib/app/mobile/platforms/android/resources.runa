Note:
Android Resource Management and Generation Module

This module provides comprehensive Android resource management including layouts,
drawables, values, animations, raw assets, and internationalization support.
Essential for creating proper Android resource structure, managing different
configurations, and handling resource compilation and optimization.

Key Features:
- Complete resource directory structure generation
- Layout XML generation and validation
- Drawable resource management (vector, raster, state lists)
- String resources and internationalization (i18n)
- Dimension, color, and style resource management
- Animation and transition resource creation
- Raw asset and font management
- Resource qualifiers and configuration handling
- Resource optimization and minification
- Theme and style inheritance management

Implements Android SDK resource standards including proper naming conventions,
configuration qualifiers, resource merging, and AAPT2 compatibility
for production Android resource management.
