Note:
Android Gradle Build System Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive Gradle build system integration for Android
projects including build configuration, dependency management, build variants,
signing configurations, and build optimization. Essential for automated builds,
continuous integration, and proper Android app packaging and distribution.

Key Features:
- Complete Gradle build script generation (build.gradle, settings.gradle)
- Android plugin configuration and version management
- Dependency management with version catalogs and conflict resolution
- Build types and product flavors configuration
- Signing configurations for debug and release builds
- ProGuard/R8 code shrinking and obfuscation
- Build performance optimization and caching
- Multi-module project support
- Custom Gradle tasks and plugins
- Continuous integration and deployment pipeline setup

Implements Gradle best practices including dependency version management,
build reproducibility, incremental compilation, and proper build
optimization for production Android development workflows.
