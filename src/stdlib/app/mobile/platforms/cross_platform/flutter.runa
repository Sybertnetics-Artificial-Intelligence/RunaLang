Note:
Flutter Cross-Platform Mobile Development Module

This module provides comprehensive Flutter framework integration for building
high-performance cross-platform mobile applications using Dart programming language.
Includes widget system management, native plugin integration, platform channels,
state management, custom rendering, and deployment to iOS, Android, web, and desktop platforms.

Key Features:
- Complete Flutter widget tree management and custom widget development
- Dart-native performance with ahead-of-time compilation optimization
- Platform channels for native code communication and plugin integration
- Advanced state management patterns (Provider, Bloc, Riverpod, GetX)
- Custom rendering engine integration with Skia graphics library
- Hot reload and hot restart development workflow optimization
- Multi-platform deployment (iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Material Design and Cupertino design system implementations
- Advanced animation framework and custom painter capabilities
- Comprehensive testing framework with widget, integration, and unit tests

Implements Flutter architecture patterns including widget composition,
reactive programming, platform adaptation, and proper lifecycle management
for production-ready cross-platform applications with native performance.
