Note:
Xamarin Cross-Platform Mobile Development Module

This module provides comprehensive Xamarin framework integration for building
cross-platform mobile applications using C# and .NET ecosystem. Includes
Xamarin.Forms UI toolkit, native API access, platform-specific implementations,
MVVM pattern support, and deployment to iOS, Android, and UWP platforms.

Key Features:
- Complete Xamarin.Forms framework with cross-platform UI components
- Native platform API access through dependency injection and custom renderers
- MVVM architectural pattern support with data binding and commanding
- Platform-specific implementation sharing with Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android
- .NET Standard library integration for business logic sharing
- Native performance optimization with ahead-of-time compilation
- Visual Studio and Visual Studio for Mac development environment integration
- NuGet package ecosystem integration for third-party libraries
- Azure DevOps and App Center integration for CI/CD and analytics
- Hot reload and XAML previewer for rapid development workflow

Implements Xamarin architecture patterns including shared projects, PCL libraries,
custom renderers, effects, and proper platform abstraction for production-ready
cross-platform applications with native performance characteristics.
