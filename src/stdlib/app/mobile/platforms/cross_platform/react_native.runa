Note:
React Native Cross-Platform Mobile Development Module

This module provides comprehensive React Native framework integration for building
cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript/TypeScript with native performance.
Includes component bridging, native module access, platform-specific code handling,
navigation management, state management, and deployment to both iOS and Android platforms.

Key Features:
- Complete React Native bridge integration and native module communication
- Cross-platform component library with platform-specific adaptations
- JavaScript bundling, hot reloading, and development server management
- Native navigation integration with React Navigation and native transitions
- State management integration (Redux, Context API, MobX) with persistence
- Platform detection and conditional rendering for iOS/Android differences
- Native performance optimization and memory management
- Metro bundler configuration and code splitting capabilities
- Third-party library integration and native dependency management
- Automated testing framework integration (Jest, Detox, Appium)

Implements React Native architecture patterns including bridge communication,
component lifecycle management, platform-specific styling, and proper
native module integration for production-ready cross-platform applications.
