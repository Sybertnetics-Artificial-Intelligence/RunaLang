Note:
Apache Cordova/PhoneGap Cross-Platform Development Module

This module provides comprehensive Apache Cordova (PhoneGap) framework integration
for building cross-platform mobile applications using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
Includes native device API access, plugin system, platform-specific configurations,
build automation, and deployment to iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms.

Key Features:
- Complete Apache Cordova framework with WebView-based application architecture
- Extensive plugin ecosystem for native device feature access (camera, GPS, etc.)
- Platform-specific configuration and resource management (config.xml, icons, splash screens)
- JavaScript-to-native bridge communication with plugin development capabilities
- Web-based UI frameworks integration (jQuery Mobile, Framework7, Ionic, etc.)
- Command-line interface (CLI) integration for project management and building
- Hot reload and live reload development workflow for rapid iteration
- Multi-platform deployment with single codebase (iOS, Android, Windows, Browser)
- Native packaging and app store deployment automation
- Performance optimization strategies for hybrid mobile applications

Implements Cordova architecture patterns including plugin development, platform hooks,
build customization, and proper WebView integration for production-ready
hybrid mobile applications with native device access capabilities.
