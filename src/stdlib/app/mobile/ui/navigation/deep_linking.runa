Note:
Deep Linking Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides deep linking and URL routing system for mobile applications.
Implements URL-based navigation, route parsing, parameter extraction, and navigation
state restoration optimized for mobile deep linking scenarios.

Key Features:
- URL route definition and parsing
- Deep link handling and navigation
- Route parameter extraction
- Query string parameter support
- Custom URL scheme handling
- Universal links support
- Route guards and middleware
- Navigation state restoration
- Nested route support
- Route aliases and redirects
- Link validation and error handling
- Integration with navigation systems

Provides complete deep linking system for building mobile applications
with URL-based navigation and external link handling.
