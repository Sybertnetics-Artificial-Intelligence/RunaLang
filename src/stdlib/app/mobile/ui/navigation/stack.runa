Note:
Stack-Based Navigation Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides stack-based navigation system for mobile applications.
Implements hierarchical navigation with push/pop operations, back button handling,
and transition animations optimized for mobile navigation patterns.

Key Features:
- Push and pop navigation operations
- Navigation stack management
- Back button and gesture handling
- Custom transition animations
- Navigation history tracking
- Deep linking support
- State restoration
- Memory management for view controllers
- Navigation bar integration
- Modal presentation over stack
- Navigation delegation
- Accessibility navigation

Provides complete stack navigation system for building intuitive mobile
application navigation with proper state management and transitions.
