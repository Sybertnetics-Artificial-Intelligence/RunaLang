Note:
Page Transitions Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides page transition and animation system for mobile applications.
Implements various transition effects, custom animations, and timing control for
navigation between screens optimized for mobile transition patterns.

Key Features:
- Predefined transition animations
- Custom transition animations
- Interactive transition gestures
- Transition timing and easing
- Platform-specific transitions
- Shared element transitions
- Page curl and slide transitions
- Fade and zoom transitions
- Custom transition delegates
- Transition interruption handling
- Performance-optimized animations
- Accessibility transition support

Provides complete transition system for building mobile applications
with smooth, engaging navigation animations and transitions.
