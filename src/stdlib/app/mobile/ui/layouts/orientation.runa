Note:
Orientation Handling Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides device orientation management for mobile applications.
Implements orientation detection, layout rotation, and interface adaptation
for portrait and landscape orientations on mobile devices.

Key Features:
- Orientation change detection
- Portrait and landscape layouts
- Rotation animation handling
- Orientation-specific constraints
- Auto-rotation control
- Forced orientation modes
- Orientation lock functionality
- Interface rotation callbacks
- Responsive orientation layouts
- Cross-platform orientation support
- Performance-optimized rotation
- Accessibility orientation support

Provides complete orientation system for building mobile applications
that gracefully handle device rotation and orientation changes.
