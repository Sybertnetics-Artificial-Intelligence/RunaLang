Note:
Safe Areas Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides safe area management for mobile applications.
Implements safe area detection, inset handling, and layout adaptation
for devices with notches, rounded corners, and home indicators.

Key Features:
- Safe area inset detection
- Notch and cutout handling
- Home indicator avoidance
- Status bar safe area management
- Dynamic safe area updates
- Landscape/portrait safe areas
- Custom safe area definitions
- Safe area constraint management
- Edge-to-edge layout support
- Platform-specific safe areas
- Accessibility safe area support
- Performance-optimized detection

Provides complete safe area system for building mobile applications
that properly handle modern device form factors and screen layouts.
