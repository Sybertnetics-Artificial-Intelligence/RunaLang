Note:
Adaptive UI Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides adaptive user interface system for mobile applications.
Implements dynamic UI adaptation based on device capabilities, screen sizes,
and user preferences optimized for diverse mobile device ecosystem.

Key Features:
- Device capability detection
- Screen size classification
- Dynamic layout adaptation
- Component size scaling
- Feature availability detection
- Platform-specific adaptations
- Accessibility adaptations
- Performance-based adaptations
- User preference adaptations
- Network-aware adaptations
- Battery-aware adaptations
- Cross-platform consistency

Provides complete adaptive UI system for building mobile applications
that automatically optimize for different devices and conditions.
