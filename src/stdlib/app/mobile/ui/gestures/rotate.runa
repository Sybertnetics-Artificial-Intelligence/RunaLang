Note:
Rotation Gestures Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides rotation gesture recognition system for mobile applications.
Implements two-finger rotation detection, angle calculation, and rotation velocity
tracking for content manipulation optimized for mobile touch interactions.

Key Features:
- Two-finger rotation recognition
- Rotation angle calculation
- Angular velocity tracking
- Rotation anchor point detection
- Rotation constraints and limits
- Combined rotation with scaling
- Snap-to-angle functionality
- Rotation gesture anchoring
- Gesture state tracking
- Platform-specific rotation behavior
- Performance-optimized detection
- Custom rotation gesture creation

Provides complete rotation gesture system for building mobile applications
with intuitive content rotation and manipulation.
