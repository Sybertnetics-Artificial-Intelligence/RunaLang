Note:
Swipe Gestures Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides swipe gesture recognition system for mobile applications.
Implements directional swipes, swipe velocity detection, and multi-finger swipe
gestures with customizable thresholds and direction constraints.

Key Features:
- Directional swipe recognition (up, down, left, right)
- Swipe velocity and distance calculation
- Multi-finger swipe support
- Diagonal swipe detection
- Swipe threshold customization
- Edge swipe recognition
- Flick gesture detection
- Swipe cancellation handling
- Simultaneous swipe recognition
- Platform-specific swipe behavior
- Performance-optimized detection
- Custom swipe gesture creation

Provides complete swipe gesture system for building mobile applications
with fluid navigation and interaction patterns.
