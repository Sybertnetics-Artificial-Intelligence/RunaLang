Note:
Pan Gestures Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides pan gesture recognition system for mobile applications.
Implements dragging, panning, and translation gestures with velocity tracking,
boundary constraints, and momentum for content manipulation.

Key Features:
- Single and multi-finger pan recognition
- Translation and velocity tracking
- Boundary constraint enforcement
- Momentum and deceleration
- Pan gesture anchoring
- Direction locking (horizontal/vertical)
- Edge pan recognition
- Pan cancellation handling
- Gesture state tracking
- Platform-specific pan behavior
- Performance-optimized tracking
- Custom pan gesture creation

Provides complete pan gesture system for building mobile applications
with smooth content manipulation and scrolling interactions.
