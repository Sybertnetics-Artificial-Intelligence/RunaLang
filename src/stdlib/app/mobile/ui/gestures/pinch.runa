Note:
Pinch Gestures Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides pinch gesture recognition system for mobile applications.
Implements pinch-to-zoom, scale detection, and rotation combined with scaling
for content manipulation optimized for mobile touch interactions.

Key Features:
- Two-finger pinch gesture recognition
- Scale factor calculation
- Zoom center point detection
- Minimum and maximum scale limits
- Velocity-based scaling
- Combined pinch and rotation
- Pinch gesture anchoring
- Scale animation integration
- Gesture state tracking
- Platform-specific pinch behavior
- Performance-optimized detection
- Custom pinch gesture creation

Provides complete pinch gesture system for building mobile applications
with intuitive content scaling and manipulation.
