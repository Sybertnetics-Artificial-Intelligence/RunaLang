Note:
Custom Gesture Recognition Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides custom gesture creation and recognition system for mobile
applications. Implements gesture pattern recording, machine learning recognition,
and custom gesture definition for application-specific interactions.

Key Features:
- Custom gesture pattern recording
- Gesture template matching
- Machine learning gesture recognition
- Multi-stroke gesture support
- Gesture velocity and timing analysis
- Custom gesture training
- Gesture similarity scoring
- Complex gesture composition
- Gesture state machine support
- Performance-optimized matching
- Cross-platform gesture support
- Accessibility custom gestures

Provides complete custom gesture system for building mobile applications
with unique and application-specific gesture interactions.
