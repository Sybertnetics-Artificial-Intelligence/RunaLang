Note:
Mobile List Components Module for Mobile UI Framework

This module provides comprehensive list and table view components optimized for mobile
interfaces. Includes various list styles, data binding, virtualization, and mobile-specific
interactions like pull-to-refresh, infinite scrolling, and swipe actions.

Key Features:
- Virtualized list views for performance
- Multiple list item layouts and styles
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Infinite scrolling and pagination
- Swipe-to-delete and swipe actions
- Sticky headers and footers
- Section headers and indexing
- Search and filtering
- Drag and drop reordering
- Selection modes (single/multiple)
- Empty state handling
- Loading states and skeleton views

Provides complete list component system for building efficient, interactive
mobile list interfaces with smooth scrolling and touch interactions.
