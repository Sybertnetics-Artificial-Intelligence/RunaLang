Airplane Mode and Radio Control Module

This module provides comprehensive airplane mode and radio frequency control for mobile applications.
Supports flight mode management, selective radio control, compliance monitoring, and power optimization.

Core Functionality:
- Airplane mode: flight mode activation, all-radio shutdown, emergency override
- Selective control: WiFi-only mode, Bluetooth exceptions, cellular blocking
- Compliance monitoring: aviation regulations, flight detection, location-based rules
- Radio management: individual radio control, power states, transmission monitoring
- Emergency features: emergency call capability, location services, safety overrides
- Power optimization: battery preservation, RF power reduction, efficiency modes
- Automation: location-based activation, schedule-based control, smart detection
- Platform integration: iOS Flight Mode, Android Airplane Mode APIs

Applications include flight utilities, battery savers, RF compliance tools,
automation apps, and any application requiring radio frequency management.
