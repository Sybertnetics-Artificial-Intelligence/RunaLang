NFC (Near Field Communication) Module

This module provides comprehensive NFC functionality for mobile applications.
Supports NFC tag reading/writing, peer-to-peer communication, and payment integration.

Core Functionality:
- Tag operations: read/write NDEF tags, format tags, lock/unlock
- Peer-to-peer: device-to-device communication, Android Beam
- Card emulation: payment cards, access cards, loyalty cards
- Reader mode: tag detection, card scanning, proximity sensing
- Payment integration: contactless payments, wallet integration
- Security: secure element access, cryptographic operations
- Advanced features: ISO14443, ISO15693, Mifare support
- Platform integration: iOS Core NFC, Android NFC APIs

Applications include payment apps, access control, data sharing, smart posters,
inventory management, and any application requiring short-range communication.
