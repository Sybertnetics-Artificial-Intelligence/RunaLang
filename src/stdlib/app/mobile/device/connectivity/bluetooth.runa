Bluetooth Connectivity Module

This module provides comprehensive Bluetooth connectivity management for mobile applications.
Supports Bluetooth Classic, BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), device discovery, and profile management.

Core Functionality:
- Device discovery: scanning, pairing, device enumeration
- Connection management: connect/disconnect, bonding, authentication
- Bluetooth Classic: audio, data transfer, traditional profiles
- BLE (Low Energy): GATT services, characteristics, energy efficiency
- Profile support: A2DP, HID, OPP, PBAP, HFP, custom profiles
- Data transfer: file transfer, streaming, real-time communication
- Security: encryption, authentication, secure pairing
- Platform integration: iOS Core Bluetooth, Android BluetoothAdapter

Applications include audio devices, IoT sensors, wearables, file sharing,
automotive integration, and any application requiring Bluetooth connectivity.
