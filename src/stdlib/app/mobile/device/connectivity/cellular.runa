Cellular Network Information Module

This module provides comprehensive cellular network information and monitoring for mobile applications.
Supports network status, signal strength, carrier information, and data usage tracking.

Core Functionality:
- Network information: carrier, network type, roaming status
- Signal monitoring: signal strength, network quality, tower information
- Data usage: cellular data tracking, usage statistics, quota management
- Network switching: 2G/3G/4G/5G selection, network preferences
- Roaming management: roaming detection, international usage
- SIM card information: ICCID, IMSI, carrier details
- Emergency services: emergency call capabilities, location services
- Platform integration: iOS Core Telephony, Android TelephonyManager

Applications include network utilities, data usage monitors, carrier apps,
roaming assistants, and any application requiring cellular network awareness.
