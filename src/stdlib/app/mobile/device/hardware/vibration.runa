Haptic Feedback and Vibration Module

This module provides comprehensive haptic feedback and vibration control for mobile applications.
Supports vibration patterns, haptic feedback, tactile responses, and advanced haptic effects.

Core Functionality:
- Basic vibration: simple vibration control, duration-based patterns
- Haptic feedback: tactile responses, system haptics, UI feedback
- Pattern vibration: custom patterns, rhythm creation, sequence control
- Intensity control: vibration strength, amplitude modulation
- Waveform generation: custom waveforms, frequency control, effects
- System integration: notification haptics, keyboard feedback, system sounds
- Accessibility: vibration for notifications, tactile assistance
- Platform integration: iOS Haptic Engine, Android Vibrator Service

Applications include UI feedback, gaming, notifications, accessibility,
meditation apps, and any application requiring tactile user interaction.
