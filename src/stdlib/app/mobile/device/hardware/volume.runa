System Volume Control Module

This module provides comprehensive system volume control for mobile applications.
Supports volume adjustment, audio routing, profile management, and sound enhancement.

Core Functionality:
- Volume control: master volume, media volume, ring/notification volumes
- Audio routing: speaker, headphones, bluetooth, external audio
- Profile management: silent, vibrate, normal, custom profiles
- Stream management: music, calls, alarms, notifications, system sounds
- Volume curves: custom response curves, loudness compensation
- Hardware integration: volume buttons, hardware keys, external controls
- Accessibility: hearing aid support, audio amplification
- Platform integration: iOS Audio Session, Android AudioManager

Applications include media players, accessibility tools, audio utilities,
profile managers, and any application requiring audio volume control.
