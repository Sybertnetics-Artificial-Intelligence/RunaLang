Flashlight and Camera Flash Module

This module provides comprehensive flashlight and camera flash control for mobile applications.
Supports torch functionality, strobe effects, brightness control, and SOS signaling.

Core Functionality:
- Basic flashlight: on/off control, torch mode, continuous lighting
- Brightness control: intensity adjustment, dimming, power levels
- Strobe effects: flashing patterns, frequency control, emergency signals
- SOS signaling: Morse code SOS, emergency patterns, distress signals
- Camera flash: photography flash, video light, synchronized lighting
- Power management: battery optimization, thermal protection
- Pattern generation: custom flash patterns, timing control
- Platform integration: iOS AVCaptureDevice, Android Camera2 API

Applications include flashlight apps, emergency tools, photography utilities,
signaling applications, and any app requiring camera flash control.
