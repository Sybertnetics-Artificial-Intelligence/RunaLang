Biometric Authentication Module

This module provides comprehensive biometric authentication for mobile applications.
Supports fingerprint, face recognition, voice recognition, and iris scanning.

Core Functionality:
- Fingerprint authentication: TouchID, FaceID, in-display sensors
- Face recognition: facial authentication, liveness detection, 3D mapping
- Voice recognition: speaker verification, voice patterns, audio biometrics
- Iris scanning: eye pattern recognition, infrared scanning
- Multi-modal authentication: combined biometric methods, fallback options
- Security features: secure element storage, template encryption
- Accessibility: alternative authentication methods, assistive support
- Platform integration: iOS Biometry, Android BiometricPrompt

Applications include security apps, banking applications, device unlocking,
payment authentication, and any app requiring secure biometric verification.
