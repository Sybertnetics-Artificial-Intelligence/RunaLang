Cloud Storage Integration Module

This module provides comprehensive cloud storage integration for mobile applications.
Supports major cloud providers, file synchronization, and cloud-based operations.

Core Functionality:
- Provider integration: Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, AWS S3, Azure Blob
- File synchronization: upload/download, bidirectional sync, conflict resolution
- Offline support: caching, offline access, sync queue, background operations
- Authentication: OAuth, API keys, token management, multi-account support
- Metadata management: file properties, versioning, sharing permissions
- Bandwidth optimization: compression, delta sync, adaptive quality
- Security: encryption, secure transfer, access control, audit logging
- Platform integration: native cloud APIs, document providers, file pickers

Applications include backup services, document editing, media sharing,
collaborative applications, and any application requiring cloud storage.
