External Storage Management Module

This module provides comprehensive external storage management for mobile applications.
Supports SD cards, USB drives, removable media, and external storage devices.

Core Functionality:
- External storage detection: device enumeration, mount status, storage identification
- SD card management: mount/unmount, format, partition, health monitoring
- USB storage: drive access, file transfer, compatibility checking
- Removable media: detection, mounting, safe removal, hot-swap handling
- Storage migration: data transfer, backup/restore, synchronization
- External file operations: read/write access, permissions, cross-device operations
- Security management: encryption, access control, secure removal
- Platform integration: Android External Storage, iOS Files app, document providers

Applications include file managers, media players, backup applications,
document editors, and any application requiring external storage access.
