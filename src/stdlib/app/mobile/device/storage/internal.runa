Internal Storage Management Module

This module provides comprehensive internal storage management for mobile applications.
Supports file operations, directory management, storage monitoring, and data organization.

Core Functionality:
- File operations: create, read, write, delete, copy, move file management
- Directory management: folder creation, navigation, hierarchy management
- Storage monitoring: space usage, available storage, capacity tracking
- Data organization: application data, user documents, temporary files
- Permissions: file access control, security permissions, sandbox management
- Metadata: file attributes, timestamps, size information, type detection
- Search and indexing: file search, content indexing, metadata queries
- Platform integration: iOS Documents, Android Internal Storage, file system APIs

Applications include file managers, document apps, media storage,
data backup, and any application requiring internal file system access.
