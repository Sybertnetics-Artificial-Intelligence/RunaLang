Application Cache Management Module

This module provides comprehensive cache management for mobile applications.
Supports various cache types, expiration policies, and performance optimization.

Core Functionality:
- Cache types: memory cache, disk cache, hybrid cache, distributed cache
- Storage policies: LRU, LFU, FIFO, TTL-based, size-based eviction
- Data types: images, JSON, binary data, database queries, API responses
- Performance: cache warming, preloading, background updates, compression
- Memory management: size limits, cleanup, garbage collection, monitoring
- Persistence: cache serialization, restoration, cross-session persistence
- Synchronization: thread safety, atomic operations, cache coherence
- Analytics: hit/miss ratios, performance metrics, usage statistics

Applications include web view caching, image caching, API response caching,
database query caching, and any application requiring performance optimization.
