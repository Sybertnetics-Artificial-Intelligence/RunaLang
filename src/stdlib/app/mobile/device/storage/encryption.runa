Storage Encryption and Security Module

This module provides comprehensive encryption and security for mobile application storage.
Supports file encryption, database encryption, and secure storage management.

Core Functionality:
- File encryption: AES, ChaCha20, RSA encryption for individual files
- Database encryption: SQLCipher, encrypted database schemas, secure queries
- Key management: key generation, derivation, rotation, secure storage
- Authentication: biometric unlock, PIN/password, multi-factor authentication
- Secure containers: encrypted folders, secure vaults, isolated storage
- Data integrity: checksums, signatures, tamper detection, audit logging
- Hardware security: HSM, secure enclaves, hardware-backed keys
- Platform integration: Android Keystore, iOS Keychain, secure hardware

Applications include secure document storage, encrypted databases, password managers,
financial applications, and any application requiring data protection.
