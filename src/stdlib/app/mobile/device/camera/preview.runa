Camera Preview and Viewfinder Module

This module provides comprehensive camera preview and viewfinder functionality for mobile applications.
Supports live preview, overlay graphics, zoom controls, touch interactions, and preview customization.

Core Functionality:
- Live preview: real-time camera feed, viewfinder display, preview streaming
- Preview controls: zoom, pan, rotation, aspect ratio, resolution scaling
- Overlay graphics: focus indicators, grid lines, level indicators, custom overlays
- Touch interactions: tap-to-focus, pinch-to-zoom, gesture recognition
- Preview effects: filters, color adjustments, real-time processing
- Frame analysis: histogram display, exposure meters, focus peaking
- Multi-camera: picture-in-picture, dual camera preview, camera switching
- Platform integration: iOS AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer, Android TextureView

Applications include camera apps, viewfinder interfaces, AR applications,
video streaming, and any application requiring live camera preview.
