Augmented Reality Camera Module

This module provides comprehensive augmented reality functionality for mobile camera applications.
Supports AR object placement, tracking, face filters, world mapping, and immersive experiences.

Core Functionality:
- Object tracking: plane detection, feature points, visual-inertial odometry (VIO)
- 3D object placement: virtual objects, anchoring, physics simulation
- Face tracking: facial landmark detection, expression analysis, face filters
- World mapping: simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), persistent anchors
- Light estimation: environmental lighting, realistic object rendering
- Occlusion handling: depth estimation, realistic object interaction
- Motion tracking: device pose, orientation, spatial movement
- Platform integration: iOS ARKit, Android ARCore, cross-platform compatibility

Applications include AR games, virtual try-on, interior design, education tools,
navigation apps, and any application requiring augmented reality experiences.
