Camera Capture and Photography Module

This module provides comprehensive camera capture functionality for mobile applications.
Supports photo capture, video recording, burst mode, HDR, manual controls, and advanced imaging.

Core Functionality:
- Photo capture: single shot, burst mode, timer, manual exposure control
- Video recording: standard video, slow motion, time-lapse, stabilization
- Image formats: JPEG, RAW, HEIF, PNG, format conversion, metadata
- Quality control: resolution selection, compression, bit rate, frame rate
- Focus and exposure: autofocus, manual focus, exposure compensation, metering
- Flash control: auto flash, fill flash, torch mode, external flash
- Advanced features: HDR, bracketing, focus stacking, panorama
- Platform integration: iOS AVFoundation, Android Camera2 API

Applications include camera apps, photography tools, video recording,
content creation, and any application requiring image/video capture.
