- Text recognition: OCR, handwriting recognition, multilingual text extraction
- Document scanning: automatic edge detection, perspective correction, text extraction
- Object recognition: image classification, product identification, landmark recognition
- Face recognition: face detection, identity verification, facial biometrics
- Color analysis: dominant colors, color matching, palette extraction
- Shape detection: geometric shapes, pattern recognition, contour analysis
- Platform integration: iOS Vision, ML Kit, Google Lens, custom ML models

Applications include shopping apps, business card scanners, translation apps,
document digitization, inventory management, and visual search applications.
