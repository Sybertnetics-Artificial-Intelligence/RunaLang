Camera Filters and Image Effects Module

This module provides comprehensive camera filters and real-time image effects for mobile applications.
Supports color filters, artistic effects, beauty filters, style transfer, and custom filter creation.

Core Functionality:
- Color filters: vintage, sepia, black & white, color grading, temperature adjustment
- Artistic effects: oil painting, watercolor, sketch, cartoon, comic book styles
- Beauty filters: skin smoothing, blemish removal, teeth whitening, eye enhancement
- Instagram-style filters: predefined looks, social media ready, trending styles
- Real-time processing: live preview filters, GPU acceleration, performance optimization
- Custom filters: user-defined effects, filter stacking, parameter adjustment
- Style transfer: AI-powered artistic styles, neural network filters
- Platform integration: iOS Core Image, Android RenderScript, GPU shaders

Applications include social media apps, photography apps, beauty cameras,
artistic photo editors, and any application requiring image enhancement or stylization.
