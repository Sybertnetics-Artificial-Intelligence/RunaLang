Camera Settings and Configuration Module

This module provides comprehensive camera settings and configuration management for mobile applications.
Supports camera parameters, image quality, exposure controls, white balance, and advanced settings.

Core Functionality:
- Image quality: resolution, compression, format, bit depth, color space
- Exposure controls: ISO, shutter speed, aperture, metering modes, compensation
- Focus settings: autofocus modes, manual focus, focus tracking, macro settings
- White balance: auto, manual, presets, color temperature, tint adjustment
- Scene modes: portrait, landscape, night, sports, macro, custom profiles
- Advanced controls: noise reduction, sharpening, color correction, lens correction
- Camera profiles: user presets, professional modes, custom configurations
- Platform integration: iOS AVCaptureDevice, Android Camera2 characteristics

Applications include professional camera apps, photography tools, manual controls,
camera configuration utilities, and any application requiring detailed camera control.
