Map Integration and Display Module

This module provides comprehensive map integration and display functionality for mobile applications.
Supports map rendering, overlays, markers, routing, and interactive map features.

Core Functionality:
- Map display: tile rendering, zoom controls, pan/scroll, map types
- Markers and annotations: point markers, custom icons, info windows, clustering
- Overlays: polylines, polygons, circles, ground overlays, heat maps
- Map interaction: touch gestures, tap events, long press, multi-touch
- Map styles: standard, satellite, terrain, hybrid, custom styling
- Offline maps: tile caching, offline rendering, map downloads
- Real-time updates: live traffic, dynamic content, streaming data
- Platform integration: Google Maps, Apple Maps, OpenStreetMap, MapBox

Applications include navigation apps, location finders, delivery tracking,
real estate apps, and any application requiring interactive map displays.
