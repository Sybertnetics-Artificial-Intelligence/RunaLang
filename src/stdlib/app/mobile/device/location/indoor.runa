- Beacon technology: iBeacon, Eddystone, AltBeacon support, proximity detection
- Indoor navigation: building maps, floor plans, turn-by-turn indoor directions
- Zone detection: room identification, area transitions, proximity triggers
- Asset tracking: indoor object location, movement monitoring, proximity alerts
- Venue mapping: building layout, point of interest mapping, wayfinding
- Real-time location: continuous indoor tracking, position updates
- Platform integration: iOS Core Location, Android Location Services, beacon frameworks

Applications include indoor navigation, retail apps, museum guides, venue management,
asset tracking, and any application requiring precise indoor location services.
