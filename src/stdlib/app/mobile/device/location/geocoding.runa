Address Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding Module

This module provides comprehensive geocoding services for mobile applications.
Supports address-to-coordinate conversion, reverse geocoding, place search, and location intelligence.

Core Functionality:
- Forward geocoding: address to coordinates, place name resolution, location search
- Reverse geocoding: coordinates to address, place identification, location description
- Batch geocoding: multiple address processing, bulk location conversion
- Place search: nearby places, points of interest, business listings
- Address validation: format checking, completeness verification, standardization
- Geocoding quality: confidence scoring, accuracy assessment, result filtering
- Multi-language support: international addresses, localized results
- Platform integration: Google Geocoding, HERE, Mapbox, OpenStreetMap Nominatim

Applications include address validation, location search, mapping applications,
delivery services, and any application requiring geographic coordinate conversion.
