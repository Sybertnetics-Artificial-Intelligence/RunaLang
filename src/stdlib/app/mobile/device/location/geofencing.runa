Geofencing and Location Alerts Module

This module provides comprehensive geofencing functionality for mobile applications.
Supports virtual boundaries, location-based alerts, proximity monitoring, and automated responses.

Core Functionality:
- Geofence creation: circular, polygonal, and complex boundary shapes
- Entry/exit detection: boundary crossing alerts, dwell time monitoring
- Proximity alerts: approaching boundaries, distance-based notifications
- Location triggers: automated actions, conditional responses, event handling
- Fence management: multiple geofences, priority levels, overlapping zones
- Real-time monitoring: continuous boundary checking, background operation
- Analytics: fence statistics, crossing history, behavioral patterns
- Platform integration: iOS Region Monitoring, Android Geofencing API

Applications include location reminders, security systems, fleet management,
marketing automation, parental controls, and location-aware applications.
