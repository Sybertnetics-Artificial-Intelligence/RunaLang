Turn-by-Turn Navigation Module

This module provides comprehensive turn-by-turn navigation functionality for mobile applications.
Supports route calculation, voice guidance, real-time traffic, and navigation assistance.

Core Functionality:
- Route calculation: fastest, shortest, scenic routes, multi-stop planning
- Turn-by-turn guidance: step-by-step directions, voice instructions, visual cues
- Real-time navigation: GPS tracking, position updates, route recalculation
- Traffic integration: live traffic data, congestion avoidance, alternative routes
- Voice guidance: text-to-speech, multilingual support, custom voice commands
- Lane guidance: lane-specific directions, highway navigation, complex intersections
- Arrival assistance: parking suggestions, final approach, destination arrival
- Platform integration: Google Directions, Apple Maps, HERE, OpenRoute Service

Applications include navigation apps, delivery services, ride-sharing,
logistics management, and location-aware transportation applications.
