Barometer Sensor Module

This module provides comprehensive barometer functionality for mobile applications.
Supports atmospheric pressure measurement, altitude detection, and weather monitoring.

Core Functionality:
- Pressure measurement: atmospheric pressure in hPa/mBar units
- Altitude calculation: elevation estimation from pressure readings
- Weather monitoring: pressure trends, weather prediction
- Elevation tracking: floor detection, hiking altimeter
- Calibration: sea level pressure correction, reference adjustment
- Trend analysis: pressure change detection, forecasting
- Indoor navigation: floor-level detection, vertical positioning
- Platform integration: iOS Core Motion, Android Pressure Sensor

Applications include weather apps, altimeters, fitness tracking, indoor navigation,
and any application requiring atmospheric pressure or elevation data.
