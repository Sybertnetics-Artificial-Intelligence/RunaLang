Accelerometer Sensor Module

This module provides comprehensive accelerometer functionality for mobile applications.
Supports motion detection, gesture recognition, device orientation, and vibration analysis.

Core Functionality:
- Acceleration measurement: 3-axis linear acceleration (x, y, z)
- Motion detection: shake gestures, tap detection, movement patterns
- Orientation tracking: device tilt, rotation relative to gravity
- Gesture recognition: custom gestures, motion signatures
- Vibration analysis: external vibration detection, frequency analysis
- Calibration: sensor calibration, bias correction, noise filtering
- Event handling: motion events, threshold-based triggers
- Platform integration: iOS Core Motion, Android Sensor Manager

Applications include fitness apps, games, navigation tools, security applications,
and any mobile app requiring motion sensing and gesture recognition.
