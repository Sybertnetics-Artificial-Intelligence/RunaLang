Sensor Fusion Module

This module provides comprehensive sensor fusion functionality for mobile applications.
Combines multiple sensor inputs for accurate device orientation, motion tracking, and context awareness.

Core Functionality:
- Multi-sensor integration: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer combination
- Device orientation: precise roll, pitch, yaw calculation with drift correction
- Motion tracking: linear acceleration, angular velocity, position estimation
- Context awareness: activity recognition, device state, environmental context
- Sensor calibration: cross-sensor calibration, bias correction
- Filter algorithms: Kalman, complementary, madgwick filters
- Coordinate systems: device, world, user coordinate transformations
- Platform integration: iOS Core Motion, Android Sensor Fusion

Applications include AR/VR, navigation, gaming, fitness tracking, robotics,
and any application requiring precise orientation and motion sensing.
