Gyroscope Sensor Module

This module provides comprehensive gyroscope functionality for mobile applications.
Supports rotation sensing, angular velocity measurement, and device stabilization.

Core Functionality:
- Angular velocity: 3-axis rotation rates (pitch, yaw, roll)
- Rotation tracking: device orientation changes, spin detection
- Stabilization: image/video stabilization, motion compensation
- Gaming input: motion controls, steering, tilting mechanics
- Navigation: dead reckoning, heading changes, rotation tracking
- Gesture recognition: rotational gestures, spin patterns
- Calibration: drift correction, bias compensation, noise filtering
- Platform integration: iOS Core Motion, Android Sensor Manager

Applications include camera stabilization, gaming, navigation, VR/AR,
and any application requiring precise rotation and orientation sensing.
