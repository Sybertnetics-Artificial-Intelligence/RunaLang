Magnetometer Sensor Module

This module provides comprehensive magnetometer functionality for mobile applications.
Supports digital compass, magnetic field detection, and navigation assistance.

Core Functionality:
- Magnetic field measurement: 3-axis magnetic field strength (microteslas)
- Digital compass: true/magnetic north, bearing calculation, heading
- Navigation: direction finding, compass rose, bearing tracking
- Metal detection: magnetic anomaly detection, metal proximity
- Calibration: hard/soft iron correction, magnetic declination
- Field mapping: magnetic field visualization, disturbance detection
- Indoor navigation: magnetic fingerprinting, location estimation
- Platform integration: iOS Core Location, Android Sensor Manager

Applications include navigation apps, compass utilities, metal detectors,
indoor positioning, and any application requiring directional awareness.
