Proximity Sensor Module

This module provides comprehensive proximity sensor functionality for mobile applications.
Supports proximity detection, automatic screen management, and gesture recognition.

Core Functionality:
- Proximity detection: object/hand detection near device screen
- Screen management: automatic on/off during calls, power saving
- Gesture recognition: hover gestures, air swipe, touchless interaction
- Distance measurement: relative distance estimation (where supported)
- Call handling: ear detection, accidental touch prevention
- Wake/sleep control: proximity-based screen state management  
- Threshold configuration: sensitivity adjustment, detection zones
- Platform integration: iOS Proximity Sensor, Android Sensor Manager

Applications include phone call interfaces, gesture controls, power management,
touchless interaction, and accessibility features for hands-free operation.
