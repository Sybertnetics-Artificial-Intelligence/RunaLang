Ambient Light Sensor Module

This module provides comprehensive ambient light sensor functionality for mobile applications.
Supports automatic brightness control, display adaptation, and lighting condition detection.

Core Functionality:
- Light measurement: ambient illumination in lux units
- Automatic brightness: screen brightness adaptation, power saving
- Display optimization: color temperature adjustment, contrast enhancement
- Lighting detection: indoor/outdoor, day/night, lighting conditions
- Camera assistance: exposure guidance, flash recommendations
- Health features: blue light filtering, eye strain reduction
- Power management: display dimming, battery optimization
- Platform integration: iOS Ambient Light, Android Light Sensor

Applications include automatic display control, camera apps, reading apps,
health monitoring, and any application requiring lighting awareness.
