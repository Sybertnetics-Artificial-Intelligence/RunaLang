Note:
Background Tasks Service Module for Mobile Applications

This module provides background task execution system for mobile applications.
Implements background app refresh, silent push handling, periodic tasks,
and long-running background operations with platform-specific optimizations.

Key Features:
- Background app refresh management
- Silent push notification handling
- Periodic background task scheduling
- Background URL session management
- Background sync operations
- Task expiration handling
- Background processing time limits
- Wake-up scheduling
- Background task prioritization
- Battery-efficient background operations
- Network-aware background tasks
- Background data synchronization
- Background media processing
- Location-based background tasks
- Background analytics collection

Provides complete background task system for building mobile applications
with efficient background processing capabilities.
