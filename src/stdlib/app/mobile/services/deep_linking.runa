Note:
Deep Linking Service Module for Mobile Applications

This module provides comprehensive deep linking system for mobile applications.
Implements URL schemes, universal links, app links, and deferred deep linking
with routing, parameter handling, and cross-platform compatibility.

Key Features:
- Custom URL scheme handling
- Universal Links (iOS) / App Links (Android)
- Deferred deep linking
- Link parameter parsing
- Deep link routing system
- Link validation and security
- Branch.io and Firebase integration
- Link attribution tracking
- Contextual deep linking
- Deep link analytics
- Link generation and sharing
- Fallback URL handling
- Cross-platform link support
- Dynamic link creation
- Link expiration management

Provides complete deep linking system for building mobile applications
with seamless navigation and user acquisition.
