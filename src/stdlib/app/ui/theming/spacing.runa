Native UI Spacing Management and Rhythm System

This module provides comprehensive spacing management functionality for native UI applications including:
- Spacing scale systems with mathematical progression and consistent rhythm
- Design token management with semantic spacing values and contextual naming
- Responsive spacing with fluid scaling and breakpoint-specific adjustments
- Vertical rhythm establishment with baseline grid alignment and text flow optimization
- Margin and padding systems with consistent spacing rules and component relationships
- Layout spacing with grid systems, flexbox gaps, and container spacing management
- Accessibility spacing with touch target sizing and interaction area requirements
- Component spacing relationships with hierarchical spacing rules and nested element handling
- Spacing validation with consistency checking and design system compliance
- Dynamic spacing calculation based on content, container, and context requirements
- Spacing animation with smooth transitions and property interpolation
- Cross-platform spacing normalization with device-specific adjustments
- Spacing performance optimization with cached calculations and efficient rendering
- Debug spacing visualization with overlay tools and spacing measurement utilities
- Spacing templates with common patterns and reusable spacing configurations
- Adaptive spacing based on user preferences, accessibility needs, and system settings
- Spacing inheritance with cascading rules and override mechanisms
- Contextual spacing with content-aware adjustments and semantic relationships
- Spacing analytics with usage tracking and optimization recommendations
- Integration with layout systems for cohesive spacing and alignment management

Spacing Foundation:
The spacing system provides mathematical precision and design consistency for UI
layout with comprehensive accessibility support, ensuring optimal visual hierarchy
and user interaction while maintaining performance and cross-platform compatibility.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes consistency, accessibility, mathematical precision, and visual harmony
while providing flexible spacing tools and maintaining optimal layout performance
through intelligent calculation caching and context-aware spacing adjustments.
