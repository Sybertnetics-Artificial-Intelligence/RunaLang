- Typography scale systems with modular scale generation and harmonic ratios
- Text styling with weight, style, decoration, and transformation properties
- Font stack creation with platform-specific font preferences and system integration
- Advanced typography features including kerning, ligatures, and OpenType support
- Responsive typography with fluid scaling and viewport-based adjustments
- Text readability optimization with line height, spacing, and contrast considerations
- Multi-language typography support with Unicode handling and script-specific requirements
- Font performance optimization with subset loading and progressive enhancement
- Typography accessibility with screen reader compatibility and dyslexia-friendly options
- Brand typography enforcement with corporate font guidelines and consistency checking
- Dynamic font loading with web font optimization and local font detection
- Typography debugging with font rendering analysis and layout inspection tools
- Text measurement and layout calculation for precise positioning and wrapping
- Font metrics extraction including ascender, descender, and x-height information
- Typography animation support with smooth font transitions and property interpolation
- Print typography optimization with high-resolution rendering and color management
- Custom font integration with font validation and licensing compliance checking
- Typography performance monitoring with loading metrics and rendering optimization
- Advanced text effects including shadows, outlines, and gradient text rendering

Typography Foundation:
The typography system provides professional-grade text rendering with comprehensive
font management, accessibility support, and performance optimization while maintaining
design consistency and readability across different platforms and languages.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes readability, accessibility, performance, and design consistency while
providing flexible typography tools and maintaining optimal text rendering quality
through intelligent font loading and advanced OpenType feature support.
