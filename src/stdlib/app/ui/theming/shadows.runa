Native UI Shadow and Elevation System

This module provides comprehensive shadow management functionality for native UI applications including:
- Drop shadow generation with realistic lighting simulation and depth perception
- Elevation system with Material Design shadow levels and z-index management
- Box shadow rendering with blur radius, spread, and color customization
- Text shadow effects with outline, glow, and embossing capabilities
- Shadow animation with smooth transitions and dynamic lighting effects
- Performance-optimized shadow rendering with GPU acceleration and caching
- Platform-specific shadow adaptation with native appearance integration
- Shadow accessibility with high contrast mode and reduced motion support
- Custom shadow profiles with artistic effects and brand-specific styling
- Shadow inheritance and cascading with component-level and theme-level control
- Realistic shadow physics with light source positioning and angle simulation
- Shadow debugging tools with visual inspection and performance analysis
- Multi-layer shadow composition for complex depth and lighting effects
- Adaptive shadow intensity based on background colors and contrast requirements
- Shadow presets with common elevation patterns and design system integration
- Real-time shadow adjustment with interactive lighting and dynamic positioning
- Shadow performance monitoring with rendering metrics and optimization recommendations
- Cross-platform shadow normalization with device-specific rendering adjustments
- Shadow validation with design consistency checking and accessibility compliance
- Integration with animation systems for smooth shadow transitions and effects

Shadow Foundation:
The shadow system provides realistic depth perception and visual hierarchy for UI
components with performance optimization, accessibility support, and cross-platform
consistency while maintaining native appearance and smooth animation capabilities.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes realistic lighting simulation, performance optimization, accessibility
compliance, and design consistency while providing flexible shadow tools and
maintaining optimal rendering performance through GPU acceleration and caching.
