Dark Mode Foundation:
The dark mode system provides comprehensive theme adaptation with automatic detection,
intelligent color transformation, and accessibility optimization while maintaining
visual consistency and performance across different lighting conditions and user preferences.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes user comfort, accessibility, energy efficiency, and visual appeal while
providing intelligent automation and maintaining design consistency through scientific
color theory and perceptual optimization for optimal dark theme experiences.
