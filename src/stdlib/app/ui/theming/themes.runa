Native UI Theme Definition and Management System

This module provides comprehensive theme management functionality for native UI applications including:
- Theme definition with hierarchical structure and inheritance patterns
- Theme composition and mixing with conflict resolution and priority handling
- Dynamic theme switching with smooth transitions and state preservation
- Theme variable system with CSS custom properties and runtime value injection
- Theme validation with consistency checking and compatibility verification
- Platform-specific theme adaptation with native appearance integration
- Theme caching with performance optimization and memory management
- Theme persistence with storage, serialization, and restoration capabilities
- Theme generation from color palettes and design system tokens
- Theme accessibility compliance with contrast validation and readability checks
- Theme versioning with migration support and backward compatibility
- Custom theme creation with user-defined variables and component overrides
- Theme debugging with inspection tools and development utilities
- Real-time theme editing with hot reload and live preview capabilities
- Theme marketplace integration with community themes and sharing capabilities
- Theme analytics with usage tracking and performance monitoring
- Multi-theme support for different application contexts and user preferences
- Theme inheritance chains with cascading rules and override mechanisms
- Theme scoping with component-level and application-level isolation
- Performance-optimized theme application with selective updates and change detection

Theme Foundation:
The theme system provides a comprehensive design foundation for native UI applications
with flexible customization, performance optimization, and accessibility compliance
while supporting complex theme relationships and dynamic runtime modifications.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes consistency, flexibility, performance, and accessibility while providing
intuitive theme authoring tools and maintaining native platform appearance integration
with comprehensive validation and debugging capabilities for robust theme management.
