Native UI Border and Outline Management System

This module provides comprehensive border management functionality for native UI applications including:
- Border style definitions with solid, dashed, dotted, and custom pattern support
- Corner radius management with uniform and individual corner customization
- Border color and gradient support with multi-color borders and transitions
- Border width control with responsive scaling and adaptive thickness
- Outline styling for focus states and accessibility indication
- Border animations with smooth transitions and dynamic styling effects
- Performance-optimized border rendering with GPU acceleration and caching
- Platform-specific border adaptation with native appearance integration
- Border accessibility with high contrast support and focus indication
- Complex border shapes with custom path definitions and geometric patterns
- Border inheritance and cascading with component-level and theme-level control
- Border validation with design consistency checking and accessibility compliance
- Artistic border effects with shadows, glows, and decorative elements
- Interactive border states with hover, active, and focus styling
- Border debugging tools with visual inspection and measurement utilities
- Multi-layer border composition for complex styling and visual depth
- Responsive border scaling with viewport-based adjustments and breakpoints
- Border performance monitoring with rendering metrics and optimization analysis
- Cross-platform border normalization with device-specific rendering adjustments
- Integration with layout systems for proper border box model handling

Border Foundation:
The border system provides comprehensive visual boundary definition for UI components
with performance optimization, accessibility support, and cross-platform consistency
while maintaining native appearance and smooth animation capabilities for borders.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes visual clarity, accessibility compliance, performance optimization, and
design consistency while providing flexible border styling tools and maintaining
optimal rendering performance through intelligent caching and GPU acceleration.
