Calendar Widget and Date Picker Component

This module provides comprehensive calendar functionality including
date selection, range selection, multiple view modes (month, year, decade),
localization support, holiday highlighting, event integration, and
customizable date restrictions for building date-aware applications.

Key Features:
- Multiple view modes (day, month, year, decade) with smooth transitions
- Date range selection with visual feedback and validation
- Single date, multi-date, and range selection modes
- Localization support for different languages and regions
- Holiday and special date highlighting with custom styling
- Event integration with calendar appointments and reminders
- Date restrictions and disabled date ranges for business rules
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility compliance
- Custom date formatting and display options
- Integration with date/time libraries and timezone support
- Mobile-friendly touch interactions and gestures
- Export functionality for selected dates and events

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient calendar rendering with optimized date calculations,
timezone handling, and internationalization designed for high-performance
date selection and calendar display across desktop and mobile platforms.

Applications:
Essential for booking systems, event management, project scheduling,
date pickers in forms, and any interface requiring date selection
with comprehensive calendar functionality and user experience.
