Basic Chart Integration and Data Visualization

This module provides comprehensive chart component functionality including
multiple chart types, data binding, interactive features, animation,
export capabilities, and accessibility support for building powerful
data visualization interfaces in applications.

Key Features:
- Multiple chart types (line, bar, pie, scatter, area, bubble)
- Dynamic data binding with real-time updates and streaming data
- Interactive features including zoom, pan, drill-down, and tooltips
- Customizable styling with themes, colors, and branding options
- Animation support for data transitions and chart updates
- Export functionality for PNG, SVG, PDF, and data formats
- Responsive design with automatic resizing and mobile optimization
- Accessibility support with screen reader compatibility
- Legend management with positioning and interactivity
- Axis customization with scaling, formatting, and labels
- Data point highlighting and selection capabilities
- Integration with data analysis and filtering systems

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient chart rendering with canvas/SVG optimization,
data transformation pipelines, and interactive event handling designed
for high-performance data visualization across platforms.

Applications:
Essential for dashboards, reporting systems, analytics applications,
scientific data visualization, business intelligence tools, and any
interface requiring graphical data representation.
