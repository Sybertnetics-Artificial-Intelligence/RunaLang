Timeline Visualization Component

This module provides comprehensive timeline functionality including
chronological event display, interactive navigation, zoom controls,
filtering and grouping, multimedia content integration, and
responsive design for building temporal data visualization interfaces.

Key Features:
- Chronological event visualization with multiple layout modes
- Interactive navigation with zoom, pan, and focus controls
- Event filtering and grouping by categories, dates, or custom criteria
- Multimedia content integration (images, videos, documents)
- Real-time updates with live data streaming capabilities
- Responsive design adapting to different screen sizes and orientations
- Event clustering and aggregation for dense timeline periods
- Custom event styling and theming with CSS integration
- Export functionality for timeline snapshots and data
- Accessibility support with screen reader compatibility
- Performance optimization for large datasets with virtual rendering
- Integration with calendar and scheduling systems

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient timeline rendering with optimized date calculations,
event positioning algorithms, and memory-efficient data handling designed
for high-performance temporal data visualization across platforms.

Applications:
Essential for project management, historical data visualization,
event scheduling, social media feeds, activity logs, and any
interface requiring chronological data presentation with interactivity.
