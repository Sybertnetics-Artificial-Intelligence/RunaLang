Data Table Component with Sorting and Filtering

This module provides comprehensive data table functionality including
sortable columns, advanced filtering, pagination, row selection,
virtual scrolling for large datasets, and customizable cell rendering
for building powerful data presentation interfaces.

Key Features:
- Dynamic data binding with reactive updates and change detection
- Column sorting with multi-column sort support and custom comparators
- Advanced filtering with text search, range filters, and custom predicates
- Pagination with configurable page sizes and navigation controls
- Row selection with single, multiple, and range selection modes
- Virtual scrolling for efficient rendering of large datasets
- Customizable cell rendering with formatters and custom components
- Column resizing, reordering, and visibility toggling
- Export functionality for CSV, Excel, and PDF formats
- Accessibility support with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Responsive design with mobile-friendly breakpoints
- Performance optimization with lazy loading and data caching

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient table rendering with virtual scrolling, optimized
sorting algorithms, and memory-efficient data handling designed for
high-performance data presentation in desktop and web applications.

Applications:
Essential for business applications, admin panels, reporting systems,
and any interface requiring structured data presentation with
interactive features and large dataset support.
