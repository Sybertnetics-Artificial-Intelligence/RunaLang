Data Grid Component with Cell Editing

This module provides comprehensive data grid functionality including
inline cell editing, data validation, formula support, frozen columns,
multi-level grouping, advanced filtering, and spreadsheet-like
interactions for complex data manipulation and presentation.

Key Features:
- Inline cell editing with validation and type conversion
- Formula support with dependency tracking and automatic calculation
- Frozen columns and rows for large dataset navigation
- Multi-level row and column grouping with aggregation
- Advanced filtering with custom predicates and operators
- Column resizing, reordering, and pinning capabilities
- Copy/paste support with clipboard integration
- Undo/redo functionality for data operations
- Export to Excel, CSV, and other data formats
- Real-time collaboration with conflict resolution
- Custom cell renderers and editors for specialized data types
- Performance optimization for large datasets with virtual scrolling

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient grid rendering with virtual scrolling, optimized
cell editing, and formula calculation engine designed for high-performance
data manipulation in business and scientific applications.

Applications:
Essential for spreadsheet applications, financial modeling, scientific
data analysis, project management tools, and any interface requiring
complex data manipulation with spreadsheet-like functionality.
