List View Component with Virtual Scrolling

This module provides comprehensive list view functionality including
virtual scrolling for large datasets, item selection, search and
filtering, drag-and-drop reordering, grouping, and customizable
item rendering for efficient list-based data presentation.

Key Features:
- Virtual scrolling for efficient rendering of large datasets
- Multiple selection modes (single, multiple, checkbox, range)
- Dynamic search and filtering with highlighting
- Drag-and-drop reordering with visual feedback
- Item grouping with collapsible group headers
- Customizable item templates and renderers
- Infinite scrolling with lazy loading support
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility features
- Context menus and item action handling
- Sorting with custom comparison functions
- Export functionality for selected items
- Responsive design with mobile touch support

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient list rendering with virtual scrolling, optimized
item management, and memory-efficient data handling designed for
high-performance list presentation across desktop and mobile platforms.

Applications:
Essential for file browsers, contact lists, message threads, search
results, catalog displays, and any interface requiring efficient
presentation of sequential data with interactive capabilities.
