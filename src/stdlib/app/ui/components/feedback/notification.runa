Notification Component System

This module provides comprehensive notification functionality including
toast notifications, banner alerts, persistent notifications, notification
management, queuing systems, user preferences, and accessibility support
for building effective user communication interfaces.

Key Features:
- Multiple notification types (success, error, warning, info, custom)
- Toast notifications with auto-dismiss and user interaction
- Banner notifications for persistent system-wide messages
- Notification positioning and stacking with collision detection
- Queue management with priority levels and rate limiting
- User preferences for notification behavior and appearance
- Action buttons and interactive notification content
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Notification history and management interface
- Accessibility compliance with screen reader announcements
- Mobile-friendly responsive design and touch interactions
- Integration with system notifications and browser APIs

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient notification management with optimized rendering,
queue processing, and state management designed for high-performance
user communication across desktop, web, and mobile platforms.

Applications:
Essential for user feedback, system alerts, operation status updates,
form validation messages, and any interface requiring user notification
with proper management and accessibility features.
