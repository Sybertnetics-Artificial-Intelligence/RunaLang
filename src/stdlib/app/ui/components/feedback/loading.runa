Loading Indicator Component System

This module provides comprehensive loading indicator functionality including
various loading animations, progress tracking, skeleton screens, overlay
management, performance monitoring, and accessibility features for
building effective loading state communication interfaces.

Key Features:
- Multiple loading indicator types (spinner, progress bar, skeleton, dots)
- Progress tracking with percentage display and estimated time remaining
- Skeleton screens for content placeholders during loading
- Loading overlay management with proper z-index and backdrop handling
- Cancellable loading operations with user feedback
- Performance monitoring and timeout handling for long operations
- Accessibility support with screen reader announcements
- Responsive design adapting to different screen sizes
- Custom animations and theming with CSS integration
- Integration with async operations and promise handling
- Loading state management for complex multi-step operations
- Mobile-friendly loading indicators with touch feedback

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient loading state management with optimized animations,
progress calculations, and memory management designed for high-performance
loading feedback across desktop, web, and mobile platforms.

Applications:
Essential for data loading, form submissions, file uploads, page
transitions, and any interface requiring loading state communication
with proper user experience and accessibility features.
