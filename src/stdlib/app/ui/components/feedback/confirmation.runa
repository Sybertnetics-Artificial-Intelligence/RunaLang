Confirmation Dialog Component System

This module provides comprehensive confirmation dialog functionality including
various confirmation types, customizable actions, risk assessment, undo
capabilities, keyboard navigation, and accessibility features for building
safe user interaction confirmation interfaces.

Key Features:
- Multiple confirmation dialog types (modal, inline, toast, drawer)
- Customizable confirmation actions with primary and secondary options
- Risk assessment and warning levels with appropriate visual treatment
- Undo capabilities for reversible actions with timeout management
- Keyboard navigation and shortcuts for quick confirmation workflows
- Accessibility compliance with proper focus management and screen readers
- Destructive action warnings with additional safeguards
- Multi-step confirmations for complex or high-risk operations
- Custom confirmation content with rich text and media support
- Integration with form validation and data loss prevention
- Mobile-friendly confirmation dialogs with touch interactions
- Analytics integration for confirmation behavior tracking

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient confirmation management with optimized dialog rendering,
focus handling, and user interaction patterns designed for safe and
intuitive confirmation workflows across all platforms.

Applications:
Essential for delete operations, data modifications, navigation changes,
form submissions, and any interface requiring user confirmation with
proper safety measures and accessibility features.
