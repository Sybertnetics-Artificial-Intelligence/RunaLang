Error Display Component System

This module provides comprehensive error display functionality including
error classification, user-friendly error messages, recovery suggestions,
error reporting, logging integration, and accessibility features for
building effective error communication interfaces.

Key Features:
- Multiple error display types (inline, modal, banner, toast)
- Error classification and severity levels with appropriate styling
- User-friendly error messages with technical details on demand
- Recovery suggestions and action buttons for error resolution
- Error reporting and logging integration with tracking systems
- Stack trace display with filtering and formatting options
- Form validation error display with field-specific messaging
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors with exponential backoff
- Error boundary support for React-like error handling
- Accessibility compliance with proper ARIA attributes
- Mobile-friendly error displays with touch interactions
- Integration with monitoring and analytics systems

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient error handling with optimized error processing,
message formatting, and user experience design focused on helping
users understand and recover from error conditions.

Applications:
Essential for form validation, API error handling, system errors,
network failures, and any interface requiring clear error
communication with recovery options and user guidance.
