- Resizable splitter handles with drag-and-drop interaction support
- Minimum and maximum pane size constraints with validation and enforcement
- Splitter position persistence and restoration across application sessions
- Animated pane resizing with smooth transitions and easing functions
- Pane collapse and expand functionality with hide/show animations
- Proportional resizing that maintains layout ratios during container changes
- Splitter styling and customization with themes and visual indicators
- Pane content management with lazy loading and efficient rendering
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility features for splitter interaction
- Touch gesture support for mobile and tablet splitter manipulation
- Splitter snapping to predefined positions and alignment guides
- Performance optimization for large numbers of panes and complex layouts
- Event handling for pane resize, collapse, and expand operations
- Integration with layout managers for automatic pane arrangement
- Pane validation and error handling with user feedback mechanisms
- Custom splitter behavior with configurable interaction modes
- Pane synchronization for coordinated resizing across multiple splitviews
- Advanced splitting patterns like golden ratio and grid-based layouts
- Pane docking and undocking with floating window support
- Splitter orientation changing with layout transformation capabilities
- Memory management for efficient pane lifecycle and resource cleanup
- Debugging tools for splitter layout analysis and performance monitoring
- Cross-platform splitter behavior with native platform integration

Splitview Foundation:
Splitviews enable flexible workspace organization by allowing users to
divide interface areas into resizable panes, providing efficient screen
real estate utilization while maintaining intuitive interaction patterns
for complex multi-document and multi-view applications.

Layout Flexibility:
Implements adaptive layout management that responds to user preferences
and content requirements while maintaining visual consistency and smooth
interaction across different screen sizes and device orientations with
intelligent constraint handling and proportional sizing.
