Tabbed Interface Foundation:
Tabbed interfaces provide efficient content organization by allowing users
to navigate between multiple content areas within a single container,
maximizing screen real estate while maintaining clear content separation
and intuitive navigation patterns.

Tab Management System:
Implements comprehensive tab lifecycle management with support for
dynamic content loading, state preservation, and efficient resource
utilization while providing smooth user interactions and maintaining
consistent interface behavior across different platforms.
