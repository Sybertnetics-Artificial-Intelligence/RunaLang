Accordion Foundation:
Accordions enable efficient information organization by allowing users
to selectively expand content sections, reducing cognitive load while
providing quick access to relevant information through intuitive
expand/collapse interactions and clear visual hierarchy.

Content Management:
Implements sophisticated content lifecycle management with support for
dynamic section addition, lazy loading strategies, and efficient memory
utilization while maintaining smooth animations and responsive user
interactions across different devices and screen sizes.
