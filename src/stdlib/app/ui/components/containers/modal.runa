- Advanced modal patterns like sidebar modals, fullscreen modals, and popup modals
- Memory management for efficient modal lifecycle and resource cleanup

Modal Foundation:
Modals provide focused interaction contexts by overlaying content above
the main interface, creating dedicated spaces for user tasks while
maintaining clear visual hierarchy and preventing accidental interactions
with underlying content through proper focus management.

Interaction Management:
Implements sophisticated interaction handling with focus trapping,
keyboard navigation, and proper event delegation while ensuring
accessibility compliance and smooth user experience across different
input methods and assistive technologies.
