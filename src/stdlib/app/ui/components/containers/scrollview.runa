Scrollview Foundation:
Scrollviews enable navigation through content larger than the available
viewport while maintaining smooth performance and intuitive user experience
across different devices and input methods, providing essential functionality
for content-rich applications and data visualization interfaces.

Viewport Management:
Implements efficient viewport management with content virtualization,
ensuring optimal performance for large datasets while providing seamless
scrolling experience with minimal memory footprint and CPU utilization
regardless of content size or complexity.
