Panel Foundation:
Panels serve as fundamental building blocks for user interface construction,
providing flexible container capabilities that adapt to content requirements
while maintaining consistent visual appearance and interaction patterns
across different platforms and device types.

Layout System:
Implements comprehensive layout management with support for absolute,
relative, and flexible positioning strategies, enabling complex interface
arrangements while ensuring responsive behavior and optimal space utilization
in diverse screen configurations and orientations.
