Multi-Selection Component with Tagging

This module provides comprehensive multi-selection functionality including
tag-based selection display, bulk operations, selection limits, hierarchical
options, search and filtering, custom validation, and accessibility support
for building flexible multi-value selection interfaces.

Key Features:
- Tag-based display of selected items with removal capabilities
- Bulk selection operations (select all, clear all, invert selection)
- Configurable selection limits with overflow handling
- Hierarchical options with parent-child relationships
- Advanced search and filtering with multiple criteria
- Custom validation rules for selection constraints
- Drag-and-drop reordering of selected items
- Import/export of selections in various formats
- Real-time selection suggestions and recommendations
- Accessibility compliance with proper ARIA attributes
- Performance optimization for large option sets
- Integration with external data sources and APIs

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient multi-selection management with optimized tag rendering,
search algorithms, and memory-efficient data handling designed for
high-performance selection interfaces across all platforms.

Applications:
Essential for category selection, user permissions, tag management,
filter systems, and any interface requiring multiple item selection
with advanced features and validation capabilities.
