Form Component with Validation and Submission

This module provides comprehensive form functionality including
field management, validation, submission handling, error display,
auto-save capabilities, and progressive enhancement for building
robust data entry interfaces with complete form lifecycle support.

Key Features:
- Dynamic form field management with add/remove capabilities
- Comprehensive validation system with real-time feedback
- Multi-step form support with navigation and progress indicators
- Auto-save functionality with draft management and recovery
- File upload handling with progress tracking and validation
- Form submission with loading states and error handling
- Conditional field display based on form state and values
- Accessibility compliance with proper labeling and navigation
- Integration with validation libraries and backend services
- Internationalization support for labels and error messages
- Custom field types and validation rules
- Form analytics and user interaction tracking

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient form state management, validation engines,
and submission handling optimized for user experience and data
integrity across desktop, web, and mobile form interfaces.

Applications:
Essential for registration forms, surveys, data entry systems,
settings panels, checkout processes, and any interface requiring
structured user input with validation and submission capabilities.
