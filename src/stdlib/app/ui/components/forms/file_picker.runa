File Picker Component with Upload Management

This module provides comprehensive file selection and upload functionality
including drag-and-drop file selection, upload progress tracking, file
validation, preview generation, batch operations, and integration with
cloud storage services for building robust file management interfaces.

Key Features:
- Drag-and-drop file selection with visual feedback and validation
- Multiple file upload with progress tracking and queue management
- File type validation with MIME type checking and custom rules
- Image preview generation with thumbnail creation and display
- Upload progress tracking with pause, resume, and cancel capabilities
- Cloud storage integration with AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox support
- File size and count limits with user-friendly error messaging
- Batch file operations including rename, delete, and organize
- Accessibility compliance with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Responsive design with mobile-friendly touch interactions
- Integration with form validation and submission systems
- Custom file processors and transformation pipelines

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient file handling with optimized upload algorithms,
progress tracking, and memory management designed for high-performance
file operations across desktop, web, and mobile platforms.

Applications:
Essential for document management, media uploads, form attachments,
profile pictures, and any interface requiring file selection and
upload capabilities with validation and progress tracking.
