Fieldset Component for Form Field Grouping

This module provides comprehensive fieldset functionality including
logical field grouping, collapsible sections, validation scoping,
conditional display, accessibility support, and responsive layout
for organizing form fields into coherent sections and improving UX.

Key Features:
- Logical grouping of related form fields with semantic structure
- Collapsible and expandable fieldsets with smooth animations
- Validation scoping for group-level validation and error handling
- Conditional fieldset display based on form state and dependencies
- Accessibility compliance with proper labeling and navigation
- Responsive layout with flexible field arrangement options
- Nested fieldsets for hierarchical form organization
- Custom styling and theming for fieldset appearance
- Field dependency management within fieldset scope
- Integration with form validation and submission systems
- Progressive disclosure for complex forms
- Export and import of fieldset configurations

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient fieldset management with optimized field grouping,
validation scoping, and layout calculations designed for organizing
complex forms with improved usability and maintainability.

Applications:
Essential for complex forms, settings panels, registration wizards,
survey forms, and any interface requiring logical organization of
form fields with grouping, validation, and accessibility features.
