Color Picker Component with Multiple Input Methods

This module provides comprehensive color selection functionality including
multiple color space support, various picker interfaces, color palette
management, accessibility features, and integration with design systems
for building flexible color selection interfaces.

Key Features:
- Multiple color picker interfaces (wheel, slider, grid, palette)
- Support for RGB, HSL, HSV, and HEX color spaces with conversion
- Custom color palette management with save and organization
- Color accessibility features including contrast checking
- Eyedropper tool integration for color sampling from screen
- Gradient creation and editing capabilities  
- Color harmony generation (complementary, triadic, analogous)
- Recent colors history with usage tracking
- Integration with design system color tokens
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility compliance
- Mobile-friendly touch interactions and gestures
- Real-time preview with transparency support

Technical Foundation:
Implements efficient color space conversions, picker rendering algorithms,
and color theory calculations designed for high-performance color
selection across design tools and applications.

Applications:
Essential for design applications, theme customization, branding tools,
content creation interfaces, and any application requiring color
selection with professional color management features.
