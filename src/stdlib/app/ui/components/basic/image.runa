Native Image Display Component Implementation

This module provides comprehensive image display functionality for native UI applications including:
- Multi-format image loading with support for common formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG)
- Image scaling and transformation with high-quality resampling algorithms
- Aspect ratio preservation with various scaling modes (fit, fill, stretch, crop)
- Image caching with memory management and automatic cache eviction
- Lazy loading with placeholder support and progressive enhancement
- Image filtering and effects with real-time processing capabilities
- Zoom and pan functionality with smooth gesture-based navigation
- Image overlay support with text, shapes, and interactive elements
- Multi-resolution image support with automatic DPI-aware selection
- Animated image playback with frame control and timing management
- Image accessibility with alternative text and descriptive content
- Performance optimization with efficient loading and rendering pipelines
- Platform-specific image format support with native codec integration
- Image metadata extraction with EXIF, color profile, and dimension information
- Error handling with fallback images and graceful degradation

Image Foundation:
The image component provides essential visual content display capabilities for native
UI applications with comprehensive format support, performance optimization, and
accessibility integration while maintaining high-quality rendering and user experience.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes high-quality visual rendering, comprehensive format support, performance
optimization, and accessibility compliance while providing flexible scaling options
and maintaining efficient memory usage for optimal image display experience.
