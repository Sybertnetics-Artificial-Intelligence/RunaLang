Native Slider and Progress Control Component Implementation

This module provides comprehensive slider and progress control functionality for native UI applications including:
- Horizontal and vertical sliders with continuous and discrete value support
- Range sliders with dual thumbs for minimum and maximum value selection
- Progress bars with determinate and indeterminate progress indication
- Progress rings and circular progress indicators with customizable appearance
- Value input validation with minimum, maximum, and step constraints
- Tick marks and labels for visual value reference and snap-to functionality
- Keyboard interaction with arrow keys and precise value adjustment
- Mouse and touch interaction with drag operations and gesture support
- Custom thumb styling and track appearance with platform theming
- Animation support for smooth value transitions and progress updates
- Accessibility integration with value announcement and keyboard navigation
- Event handling for value changes, drag operations, and interaction states
- Performance optimization for smooth dragging and real-time updates
- Integration with data binding for automatic value synchronization

Slider Foundation:
The slider component family provides essential range input and progress
indication controls for native UI applications with comprehensive interaction
support, accessibility compliance, and platform integration capabilities.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes intuitive value manipulation, clear visual feedback, precise
input control, and accessibility support while providing flexible customization
options and maintaining smooth interaction performance across input methods.
