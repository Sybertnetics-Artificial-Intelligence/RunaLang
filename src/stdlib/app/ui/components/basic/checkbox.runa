Native Checkbox and Radio Button Component Implementation

This module provides comprehensive checkbox and radio button functionality for native UI applications including:
- Standard checkboxes with checked, unchecked, and indeterminate states
- Radio button groups with single selection enforcement and group management
- Toggle switches with smooth state transitions and visual feedback
- Tri-state checkboxes for hierarchical selection and parent-child relationships
- Checkbox groups with multi-selection support and state synchronization
- Platform-native styling with system theme integration and customization
- Keyboard interaction with Space key activation and arrow key navigation
- Mouse and touch interaction with proper hit testing and feedback
- Label association with click-to-toggle functionality and accessibility binding
- State change animations with smooth transitions and visual effects
- Validation integration for form requirements and constraint checking
- Accessibility support with screen reader compatibility and semantic markup
- Custom styling options with colors, sizes, and visual indicators
- Event handling for state changes, focus, and interaction events

Checkbox Foundation:
The checkbox component family provides essential selection controls for native
UI applications with comprehensive state management, accessibility support,
and platform integration while maintaining intuitive interaction patterns.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes clear visual feedback, intuitive interaction behavior, accessibility
compliance, and consistent state management while providing flexible customization
options and maintaining platform-native appearance and behavior patterns.
