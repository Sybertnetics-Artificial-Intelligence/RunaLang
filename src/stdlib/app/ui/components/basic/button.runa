Native Button Component Implementation

This module provides comprehensive button component functionality for native UI applications including:
- Standard button variants with text, icon, and combination styles
- Toggle button functionality with state management and visual feedback
- Button groups with radio button behavior and multi-selection support
- Icon buttons with scalable vector graphics and accessibility labeling
- Split buttons with primary action and dropdown menu integration
- Button states including normal, hover, pressed, disabled, and focused
- Keyboard interaction with Enter and Space key activation
- Touch interaction with proper touch feedback and gesture recognition
- Platform-native button styling with system theme integration
- Custom button styling with colors, fonts, borders, and effects
- Button sizing with automatic content fitting and manual size control
- Accessibility integration with screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- Animation support for state transitions and visual feedback
- Event handling with click, press, release, and hover events

Button Foundation:
The button component provides a fundamental interactive element for native
UI applications with comprehensive platform integration, accessibility support,
and extensive customization capabilities while maintaining native appearance.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes platform-native appearance and behavior, comprehensive accessibility
support, performance optimization, and flexible customization while ensuring
consistent interaction patterns across different platforms and input methods.
