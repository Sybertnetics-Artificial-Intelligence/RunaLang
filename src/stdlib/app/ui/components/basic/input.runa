Native Text Input Component Implementation

This module provides comprehensive text input functionality for native UI applications including:
- Single-line and multi-line text input with cursor management and text editing
- Input validation with real-time feedback and error highlighting
- Text input masks and formatting for structured data entry
- Placeholder text and hint display with proper accessibility support
- Auto-completion and suggestion display with keyboard navigation
- Input method editor (IME) support for international text input
- Text selection, cut, copy, and paste operations with clipboard integration
- Undo and redo functionality with action history management
- Input field styling with borders, backgrounds, and focus indicators
- Password input with secure text hiding and visibility toggle
- Numeric input with format validation and increment/decrement controls
- Keyboard shortcuts and navigation with proper focus management
- Accessibility integration with screen reader support and semantic labeling
- Performance optimization with efficient text processing and rendering

Input Foundation:
The input component provides essential text entry capabilities for native
UI applications with comprehensive validation, accessibility support, and
platform integration while maintaining optimal input performance and usability.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes intuitive text entry experience, comprehensive validation capabilities,
accessibility compliance, and cross-platform input method support while providing
flexible customization options and maintaining secure input handling practices.
