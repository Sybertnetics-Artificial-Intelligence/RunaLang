Native Text Label Component Implementation

This module provides comprehensive text label functionality for native UI applications including:
- Static text display with single and multi-line support
- Rich text formatting with fonts, colors, styles, and effects
- Text alignment and positioning with flexible layout options
- Word wrapping and text overflow handling with ellipsis and scrolling
- Internationalization support with right-to-left languages and localization
- Font management with family selection, sizing, and weight control
- Text measurement and metrics for layout calculations
- Hyperlink support with click handling and visual styling
- Text selection and copying functionality for user interaction
- Accessibility integration with screen reader support and semantic markup
- Platform-native text rendering with subpixel precision and font hinting
- Performance optimization with text caching and efficient updates
- Text animation support for smooth transitions and effects
- Responsive text scaling based on system settings and user preferences

Label Foundation:
The label component provides essential text display capabilities for native
UI applications with comprehensive formatting options, accessibility support,
and platform integration while maintaining optimal rendering performance.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes high-quality text rendering, comprehensive internationalization
support, accessibility compliance, and performance optimization while providing
flexible formatting and styling capabilities for diverse text display needs.
