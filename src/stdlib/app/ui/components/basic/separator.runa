Native Separator and Spacer Component Implementation

This module provides comprehensive separator and spacer functionality for native UI applications including:
- Horizontal and vertical line separators with customizable styling and thickness
- Spacer elements for flexible layout spacing and content alignment
- Divider components with text labels and icon integration capabilities
- Gradient separators with multi-color transitions and directional control
- Dotted and dashed separator patterns with customizable spacing and appearance
- Separator grouping for complex visual organization and hierarchy
- Responsive separator sizing with automatic layout adaptation
- Themed separators with consistent styling across application components
- Separator accessibility with proper semantic roles and screen reader support
- Animated separators with fade-in, slide, and expansion effects
- Interactive separators with hover states and click handling for collapsible sections
- Platform-native separator appearance with system theme integration
- Custom separator graphics with image and vector-based visual elements
- Separator performance optimization with efficient rendering and caching
- Context-aware separators that adapt to surrounding content and layout

Separator Foundation:
The separator component provides essential visual organization capabilities for native
UI applications with comprehensive styling options, accessibility support, and
platform integration while maintaining efficient rendering and layout performance.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes visual clarity, flexible layout support, accessibility compliance, and
performance optimization while providing comprehensive customization options and
maintaining consistent appearance across different platforms and themes.
