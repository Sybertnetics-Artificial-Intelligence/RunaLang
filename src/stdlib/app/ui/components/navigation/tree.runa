Tree Foundation:
Tree views provide hierarchical data visualization through expandable node
structures, enabling efficient navigation and understanding of complex
data relationships while maintaining clear parent-child relationships
and intuitive interaction patterns for data exploration.

Hierarchical Management:
Implements sophisticated hierarchical data management with support for
dynamic node generation, efficient rendering strategies, and responsive
interaction handling while ensuring optimal performance across various
tree sizes and complexity levels.
