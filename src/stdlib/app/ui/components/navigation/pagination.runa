Pagination Foundation:
Pagination provides structured navigation through large datasets by dividing
content into manageable pages, enabling efficient data browsing while
maintaining performance and user experience through clear navigation
controls and intuitive page management interfaces.

Data Navigation:
Implements sophisticated data navigation management with support for
dynamic page calculation, responsive control adaptation, and efficient
data loading strategies while ensuring optimal user experience across
various data sizes and interaction patterns.
