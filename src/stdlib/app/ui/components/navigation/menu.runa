Menu Foundation:
Menus provide structured navigation interfaces that organize actions and
destinations into logical hierarchies, enabling efficient user interaction
through familiar interaction patterns while maintaining clear visual
organization and accessibility across different platforms and devices.

Navigation Architecture:
Implements comprehensive navigation management with support for complex
menu structures, dynamic content loading, and responsive behavior while
ensuring optimal performance and user experience across various interaction
methods and assistive technologies.
