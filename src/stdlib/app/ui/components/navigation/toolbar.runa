Toolbar Foundation:
Toolbars provide immediate access to frequently used actions through
visually organized button collections, enabling efficient workflow
management while maintaining clear action grouping and consistent
interaction patterns across different application contexts.

Action Management:
Implements sophisticated action management with support for context-sensitive
button states, command routing, and responsive layout adaptation while
ensuring optimal performance and user experience across various interaction
methods and device capabilities.
