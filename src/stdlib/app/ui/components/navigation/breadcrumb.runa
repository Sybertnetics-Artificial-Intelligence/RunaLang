Breadcrumb Foundation:
Breadcrumbs provide contextual navigation by displaying the hierarchical
path to the current location, enabling users to understand their position
within the application structure and navigate efficiently to parent levels
while maintaining clear spatial orientation.

Navigation Context:
Implements sophisticated navigation context management with support for
dynamic path generation, responsive display adaptation, and efficient
path tracking while ensuring optimal user experience across various
navigation patterns and application architectures.
