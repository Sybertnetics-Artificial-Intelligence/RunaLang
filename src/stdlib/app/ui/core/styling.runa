Native UI Styling System and Theme Management

This module provides comprehensive styling capabilities for native UI applications including:
- Theme management with light and dark mode support
- Style property system with inheritance and cascading rules
- Color management with palette generation and accessibility compliance
- Font management with family selection, sizing, and rendering options
- Layout styling with margins, padding, borders, and spacing control
- Visual effects including shadows, gradients, and transparency
- Animation styling with transition properties and keyframe definitions
- Platform-native theme integration with system appearance synchronization
- Custom theme creation and modification with live preview capabilities
- Style inheritance and override mechanisms for component hierarchies
- Performance-optimized style calculation and application
- Responsive styling with size-based and platform-based adaptations
- Style debugging and inspection tools for development
- CSS-like property syntax with native UI optimizations

Styling Foundation:
The styling system provides a powerful and flexible approach to UI appearance
management that bridges CSS-like declarative styling with native UI performance
and platform integration while maintaining consistent visual hierarchies.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes declarative style definitions, efficient style inheritance,
and platform-native appearance integration while providing fine-grained
control over visual properties and supporting dynamic theme switching.
