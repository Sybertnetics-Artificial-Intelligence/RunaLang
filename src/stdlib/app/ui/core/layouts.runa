Layout Managers and Positioning System

This module provides comprehensive layout management for native UI applications including:
- Grid layout with flexible column and row definitions
- Flexbox layout with advanced alignment and distribution options
- Absolute positioning with precise coordinate control
- Dock layout for panel-based interfaces and tool windows
- Stack layout for layered content and z-order management
- Constraint-based layout with relationship definitions and automatic solving
- Responsive layout with breakpoints and adaptive sizing
- Layout animation and smooth transitions between layout states
- Performance-optimized layout calculation with incremental updates
- Cross-platform layout adaptation with platform-specific adjustments
- Layout debugging and visualization tools for development
- Custom layout manager creation and registration framework
- Layout caching and memoization for complex hierarchies
- Integration with widget system for seamless layout management

Layout Foundation:
The layout system provides flexible and powerful positioning capabilities
for native UI applications. It abstracts platform differences while
maintaining performance through efficient layout calculation and caching.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes declarative layout definitions, automatic constraint solving,
and performance optimization through intelligent caching and incremental
updates. Supports both immediate-mode and retained-mode layout paradigms.
