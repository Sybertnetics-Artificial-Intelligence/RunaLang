Native UI Accessibility Support and Assistive Technology Integration

This module provides comprehensive accessibility capabilities for native UI applications including:
- Screen reader integration with platform-specific accessibility APIs (MSAA, UIAutomation, NSAccessibility, AT-SPI)
- Keyboard navigation with focus management and tab order control
- High contrast mode support with theme adaptation and color adjustments
- Magnification support with zoom functionality and smooth panning
- Voice control integration with speech recognition and command processing
- Alternative input device support including switch navigation and eye tracking
- ARIA-like semantic markup for native UI elements with role and property definitions
- Accessibility tree construction and maintenance with dynamic updates
- WCAG compliance checking and automated accessibility testing
- Internationalization support with right-to-left languages and cultural adaptations
- Accessibility event notification and change announcements
- Custom accessibility provider implementation for specialized UI components
- Performance-optimized accessibility with efficient tree updates and caching
- Developer tools for accessibility testing and validation

Accessibility Foundation:
The accessibility system ensures native UI applications are usable by people
with disabilities through comprehensive assistive technology integration and
compliance with accessibility standards and platform requirements.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes universal design principles, seamless assistive technology integration,
and performance optimization while maintaining full compatibility with platform
accessibility frameworks and providing extensive customization capabilities.
