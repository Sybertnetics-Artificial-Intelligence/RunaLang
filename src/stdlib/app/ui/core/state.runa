Native UI State Management and Reactive Updates

This module provides comprehensive state management capabilities for native UI applications including:
- Application state management with centralized store pattern and immutable state trees
- Component state management with local state isolation and parent-child synchronization
- Reactive state updates with automatic UI synchronization and change propagation
- State persistence with serialization, storage, and restoration across application sessions
- Undo/redo functionality with action history and state snapshots
- State validation with type checking, constraint enforcement, and error handling
- Performance-optimized state updates with batching, memoization, and selective rendering
- State debugging with time-travel debugging and state inspection tools
- Cross-component state sharing with publish-subscribe patterns and event-driven updates
- State migration and versioning for application updates and schema evolution
- Memory-efficient state management with automatic cleanup and garbage collection
- Thread-safe state operations with concurrent access protection and atomic updates
- State analytics and monitoring for performance optimization and usage tracking
- Integration with data binding for automatic UI updates and two-way data flow

State Foundation:
The state management system provides a robust, scalable foundation for managing
application and component state with reactive updates, ensuring consistency
and performance while supporting complex state relationships and transformations.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes immutable state patterns, predictable state transitions, efficient
change detection, and comprehensive debugging capabilities while maintaining
optimal performance through intelligent batching and selective updates.
