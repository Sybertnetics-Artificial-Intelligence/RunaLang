Native UI Event System and Handler Management

This module provides comprehensive event handling for native UI applications including:
- Native event capture, processing, and dispatch with proper event propagation
- Mouse events with button states, wheel scrolling, and drag-and-drop operations
- Keyboard events with key codes, modifiers, and input method editor support
- Touch and gesture events for mobile and touchscreen interfaces
- Window events for resize, move, focus, and state change notifications
- Custom event creation and dispatch with application-specific event types
- Event delegation and bubbling with capture and target phase handling
- Event filtering and transformation with middleware-style event processors
- Performance-optimized event queue with priority-based processing
- Cross-platform event normalization and platform-specific event handling
- Event recording and replay for testing and debugging purposes
- Event analytics and profiling for performance optimization
- Accessibility event integration with screen reader and assistive technology support
- Real-time event monitoring and debugging tools for development

Event Foundation:
The event system provides a unified, high-performance interface for handling
all types of native UI events while maintaining platform compatibility and
ensuring proper event ordering and propagation semantics.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes low-latency event processing, memory-efficient event handling,
and comprehensive event type support with extensible custom event capabilities
while maintaining compatibility with native platform event systems.
