Base Widget System and Component Hierarchy

This module provides the foundational widget system for native UI applications including:
- Base widget class with lifecycle management and property binding
- Widget hierarchy and parent-child relationship management
- Component lifecycle (initialization, mounting, updating, destruction)
- Property system with data binding and change notifications
- Event handling registration and delegation within widget tree
- Widget tree traversal and query operations
- Platform abstraction layer for native widget mapping
- Memory management and resource cleanup for widget instances
- Widget state management with persistence and restoration
- Performance optimization with dirty flagging and batch updates
- Accessibility integration with semantic widget information
- Custom widget creation and registration framework
- Widget composition and containment patterns
- Cross-platform widget adaptation and platform-specific implementations

Widget Foundation:
The widget system forms the core foundation for all UI components in Runa
native applications. It provides a unified abstraction layer over platform-
specific UI toolkits while maintaining performance and native look-and-feel.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes performance-first design with zero-allocation patterns where possible,
type-safe property binding, and comprehensive lifecycle management that prevents
memory leaks while providing flexible component composition and reuse.
