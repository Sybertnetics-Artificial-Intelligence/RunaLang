Native UI Rendering Pipeline and Graphics Operations

This module provides comprehensive rendering capabilities for native UI applications including:
- Graphics context management with hardware acceleration support
- Drawing primitives including shapes, paths, and complex geometry
- Text rendering with font management, typography, and internationalization
- Image rendering with scaling, filtering, and format conversion
- Canvas operations with layers, compositing, and blend modes
- Performance-optimized rendering pipeline with dirty region tracking
- Platform-specific rendering backends (DirectX, Metal, OpenGL, Vulkan)
- High-DPI and multi-monitor support with automatic scaling
- Clipping and masking operations for complex visual compositions
- Vector graphics rendering with scalable and resolution-independent graphics
- Bitmap caching and texture management for performance optimization
- Real-time rendering with frame rate optimization and vsync support
- Accessibility rendering integration with high contrast and magnification support
- Debug rendering with wireframes, bounds visualization, and performance overlays

Rendering Foundation:
The rendering system provides a high-performance, cross-platform graphics
pipeline that abstracts platform differences while leveraging hardware
acceleration and native graphics APIs for optimal performance.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes immediate-mode and retained-mode rendering paradigms with
intelligent caching, efficient resource management, and platform-native
graphics API integration while maintaining consistent visual quality.
