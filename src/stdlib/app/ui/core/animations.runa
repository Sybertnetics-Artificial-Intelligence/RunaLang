Native UI Animation System and Motion Graphics

This module provides comprehensive animation capabilities for native UI applications including:
- Timeline-based animation system with keyframe interpolation and sequencing
- Property animations with automatic value interpolation between start and end states
- Transition animations for smooth state changes and layout updates
- Physics-based animations with spring dynamics, momentum, and realistic motion
- Gesture-driven animations with interactive manipulation and gesture recognition
- Path-based animations with bezier curves and complex motion trajectories
- Parallel and sequential animation composition with synchronization and dependencies
- Performance-optimized animations with hardware acceleration and frame-rate adaptation
- Easing functions with cubic bezier curves and custom timing functions
- Animation event handling with start, update, completion, and cancellation callbacks
- Cross-platform animation support with platform-specific optimizations
- Animation debugging and profiling tools for performance analysis
- Real-time animation parameter adjustment and live preview capabilities
- Memory-efficient animation with object pooling and resource management

Animation Foundation:
The animation system provides a powerful and flexible framework for creating
smooth, performant animations that enhance user experience while maintaining
optimal performance through hardware acceleration and intelligent resource management.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes declarative animation definitions, physics-based natural motion,
performance optimization through GPU acceleration, and comprehensive animation
composition capabilities while providing fine-grained control over timing and behavior.
