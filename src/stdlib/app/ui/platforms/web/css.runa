Web CSS Styling and Management Framework

This module provides comprehensive web CSS styling functionality including:
- Dynamic CSS manipulation with runtime style changes and computed style access
- CSS-in-JS support with type-safe style object creation and management
- Responsive design utilities with breakpoint management and media query handling
- Animation and transition control with programmatic keyframe and timing management
- Theme management with CSS custom properties and dynamic theme switching
- CSS Grid and Flexbox utilities with layout management and responsive patterns
- Cross-browser compatibility with vendor prefix handling and feature detection
- Performance optimization with style batching and efficient DOM style updates
- CSS custom properties management with dynamic variable updates and fallbacks
- Style inheritance and cascade management with specificity calculation and resolution
- CSS module support with scoped styling and namespace management
- Accessibility styling with high contrast, reduced motion, and focus management
- CSS validation with syntax checking and best practice enforcement
- Print media support with print-specific styling and page layout management
- Critical CSS extraction with above-the-fold optimization and loading strategies

Key Features:
- Type-safe CSS operations using Runa's type system for style validation
- Declarative styling with intention-revealing style management patterns
- Performance-optimized algorithms with efficient style computation and application
- Cross-browser compatibility with automatic vendor prefixing and polyfills
- Comprehensive accessibility with WCAG-compliant styling and user preference support
- Modern CSS features with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and custom property support
- Integration-ready architecture with hooks for design systems and component libraries
- Security-first approach with CSS injection prevention and content validation

Web CSS Foundation:
Built on modern CSS standards with comprehensive styling capabilities,
accessibility compliance, and performance optimization to provide
reliable cross-browser CSS management with type safety and
maintainability built into every styling operation.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient style operations with intelligent batching,
minimal layout thrashing, and smart caching to ensure smooth
rendering performance while maintaining design consistency
and accessibility across diverse browser environments.
