Web DOM Manipulation and Management Framework

This module provides comprehensive web DOM manipulation functionality including:
- Cross-browser DOM manipulation with unified API and compatibility layer
- Element creation and modification with type-safe property and attribute handling
- Event system integration with modern event handling and delegation patterns
- Performance-optimized DOM operations with batching and virtual DOM concepts
- Accessibility-compliant DOM structure with ARIA attributes and semantic markup
- Custom element support with web components and shadow DOM integration
- DOM traversal and querying with efficient selection and filtering algorithms
- Real-time DOM synchronization with state management and reactive updates
- Memory management with proper element cleanup and reference management
- Browser compatibility with polyfills and feature detection mechanisms
- Security features with XSS prevention and content sanitization
- Animation integration with DOM-based animations and transition effects
- Form handling with validation, serialization, and user interaction management
- Template rendering with dynamic content generation and data binding
- Internationalization support with locale-aware content and direction handling

Key Features:
- Type-safe DOM operations using Runa's type system for runtime safety
- Declarative DOM manipulation with intention-revealing operation patterns
- Performance-optimized algorithms with efficient tree traversal and modification
- Cross-browser compatibility with feature detection and graceful degradation
- Comprehensive accessibility with WCAG compliance and screen reader support
- Modern web standards with HTML5 semantics and progressive enhancement
- Integration-ready architecture with hooks for frameworks and state management
- Security-first approach with built-in XSS protection and content validation

Web DOM Foundation:
Built on modern web standards with comprehensive DOM manipulation
capabilities, accessibility compliance, and performance optimization
to provide reliable cross-browser DOM operations with type safety
and security built into every interaction pattern.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient DOM operations with intelligent batching,
minimal reflows and repaints, and smart caching to ensure smooth
user experiences while maintaining security and accessibility
across diverse browser environments and device capabilities.
