Responsive Design Foundation:
Built on mobile-first responsive principles with comprehensive device
adaptation, performance optimization, and accessibility compliance
to provide optimal user experiences across diverse devices, screen sizes,
and interaction methods with intelligent content and layout adaptation.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient responsive behavior with smart resource loading,
adaptive content delivery, and minimal layout shifts to ensure smooth
experiences across devices while maintaining design consistency
and accessibility across diverse screen sizes and device capabilities.
