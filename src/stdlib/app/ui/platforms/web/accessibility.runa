Web Accessibility Foundation:
Built on inclusive design principles with comprehensive accessibility
compliance, assistive technology optimization, and universal usability
to provide equal access and optimal user experiences for all users
regardless of abilities, technologies, or interaction methods.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for efficient accessibility support with intelligent ARIA
management, minimal performance overhead, and smart resource utilization
to ensure smooth experiences for assistive technologies while
maintaining optimal performance for all users across diverse access methods.
