- Cross-distribution compatibility with support for major Linux distributions

Key Features:
- Universal Linux support with automatic desktop environment detection and adaptation
- Type-safe system integration using Runa's type system for safe system calls
- Declarative UI with intention-revealing component definitions and theme integration
- Performance-optimized rendering with hardware acceleration and efficient drawing
- Comprehensive accessibility with AT-SPI compliance and screen reader support
- Modern Linux features with Wayland support and contemporary desktop integration
- Integration-ready architecture with hooks for desktop services and system features
- Standards-compliant implementation with FreeDesktop specifications adherence

Linux UI Foundation:
Built on Linux desktop integration principles with comprehensive multi-environment
support, FreeDesktop standards compliance, and cross-distribution compatibility
to provide native Linux application experiences with full system feature
utilization and desktop environment consistency across diverse configurations.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for Linux performance with efficient X11/Wayland integration,
minimal resource usage, and Linux-specific optimization techniques to
ensure smooth UI performance while maintaining native look-and-feel
and comprehensive desktop environment integration across all supported distributions.
