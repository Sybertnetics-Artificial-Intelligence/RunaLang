- Accessibility keyboard support with sticky keys, filter keys, and navigation assistance
- Gaming keyboard integration with anti-ghosting, N-key rollover, and macro support
- Virtual keyboard support with on-screen keyboards and touch-friendly input
- Key combination detection with modifier key handling and chord recognition
- Text input optimization with predictive text, auto-correction, and text expansion
- Multi-language input with language switching and character set support
- Hardware keyboard detection with device identification and capability reporting
- Custom key bindings with user-configurable shortcuts and command mapping
- Keyboard state management with key press tracking and state synchronization
- Security features with secure input modes and keylogger protection
- Performance optimization with efficient event processing and minimal latency

Key Features:
- Platform-agnostic design with unified keyboard abstractions and consistent behavior
- Type-safe input handling using Runa's type system for safe event processing
- Declarative keyboard configuration with intention-revealing input patterns
- Real-time processing with low-latency input handling and responsive feedback
- Comprehensive accessibility with keyboard-only navigation and screen reader support
- Modern input methods with emoji input, symbol selection, and special characters
- Integration-ready architecture with hooks for custom input processing and filtering
- Standards-compliant implementation with platform keyboard guidelines and conventions

Desktop Keyboard Foundation:
Built on cross-platform keyboard principles with comprehensive input
method support, accessibility compliance, and performance optimization
to provide consistent keyboard experiences across Windows, macOS,
and Linux desktop environments with full localization and customization.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for responsive keyboard input with efficient event processing,
minimal input latency, and smart resource management to ensure smooth
typing experiences while supporting complex input methods and
accessibility features across diverse keyboard hardware and software configurations.
