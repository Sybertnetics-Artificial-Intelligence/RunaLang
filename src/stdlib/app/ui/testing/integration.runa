Integration Testing Foundation:
The integration testing framework provides comprehensive multi-component testing capabilities
with realistic scenario simulation, service integration validation, and performance analysis
while maintaining test isolation and providing detailed reporting for system quality assurance.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes realistic scenario testing, comprehensive integration validation, test automation,
and system reliability while providing intuitive testing workflows and maintaining efficient
test execution through intelligent test orchestration and parallel processing capabilities.
