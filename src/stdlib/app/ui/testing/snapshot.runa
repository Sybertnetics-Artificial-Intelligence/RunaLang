Snapshot Testing Foundation:
The snapshot testing system provides comprehensive visual regression detection with intelligent
comparison algorithms, automated baseline management, and detailed change analysis while
maintaining test stability and providing efficient snapshot storage and processing.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes visual consistency, automated regression detection, developer productivity, and
test reliability while providing intelligent change analysis and maintaining efficient
snapshot processing through optimized storage and comparison algorithms.
