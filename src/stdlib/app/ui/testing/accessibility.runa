Accessibility Testing Foundation:
The accessibility testing framework provides comprehensive compliance validation with automated
testing capabilities, assistive technology simulation, and detailed reporting while ensuring
inclusive user experience and maintaining accessibility standards across all user interactions.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes inclusive design validation, comprehensive compliance checking, automated testing
efficiency, and accessibility awareness while providing actionable feedback and maintaining
seamless integration with development workflows for continuous accessibility improvement.
