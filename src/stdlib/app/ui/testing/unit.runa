Unit Testing Foundation:
The unit testing framework provides comprehensive component testing capabilities with isolation,
mocking, and validation tools while maintaining test performance and providing detailed
analysis and reporting for robust component quality assurance and validation.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes component isolation, comprehensive test coverage, developer productivity, and
test reliability while providing intuitive testing APIs and maintaining efficient test
execution through intelligent test organization and parallel processing capabilities.
