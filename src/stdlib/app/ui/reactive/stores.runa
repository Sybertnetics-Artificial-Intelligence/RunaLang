Native UI Global State Stores and Management System

This module provides comprehensive state store functionality for native UI applications including:
- Global state store creation with centralized state management and immutable data structures
- Store modules with namespaced state organization and hierarchical store composition
- Store subscriptions with selective updates and efficient change notifications
- Action dispatching with type-safe action creators and payload validation
- Store middleware with interceptors, logging, and transform capabilities
- State persistence with serialization, storage, and restoration across application sessions
- Store hydration with server-side state initialization and client-side synchronization
- Time-travel debugging with action replay and state inspection capabilities
- Store plugins with extensible functionality and third-party integration support
- Cross-store communication with event-based messaging and state synchronization
- Performance-optimized store operations with change batching and selective updates
- Store validation with state constraints and consistency checking
- Store testing utilities with mock stores, action simulation, and state assertions
- Store analytics with action tracking, performance monitoring, and usage analysis
- Thread-safe store operations with concurrent access protection and atomic updates
- Store composition with complex state relationships and dependency management
- Hot module reloading with store state preservation during development
- Store devtools integration with debugging interfaces and inspection tools
- Advanced store patterns with reactive programming and functional composition
- Store security with access control, state sanitization, and secure serialization

Store Foundation:
The state store system provides centralized, predictable state management with comprehensive
debugging capabilities, performance optimization, and extensibility while maintaining
type safety and providing flexible store composition patterns for complex applications.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes predictable state mutations, immutable data patterns, developer experience,
and performance optimization while providing comprehensive debugging tools and maintaining
efficient state synchronization through intelligent change detection and batching.
