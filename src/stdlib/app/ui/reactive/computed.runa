dependency tracking, intelligent caching, and performance optimization while maintaining
consistency and providing comprehensive debugging capabilities for complex computations.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes lazy evaluation, dependency optimization, memory efficiency, and developer
productivity while providing intelligent caching strategies and maintaining efficient
computation through automatic dependency management and selective invalidation.
