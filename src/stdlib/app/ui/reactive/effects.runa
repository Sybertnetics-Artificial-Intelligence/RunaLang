Native UI Side Effects and Reactive Updates System

This module provides comprehensive side effect management functionality for native UI applications including:
- Side effect creation with automatic dependency tracking and cleanup management
- Effect scheduling with priority-based execution and optimal timing control
- Async effect handling with promise-based execution and error recovery mechanisms
- Effect cleanup with automatic resource disposal and memory leak prevention
- Conditional effects with dependency-based execution and selective triggering
- Effect batching with grouped execution and performance optimization
- Cross-component effects with global state synchronization and communication
- Effect debugging tools with execution tracing and performance analysis
- Custom effect hooks with user-defined side effect patterns and lifecycle management
- Effect cancellation with interrupt handling and graceful termination
- Effect composition with complex side effect chains and dependency relationships
- Performance-optimized effect execution with minimal overhead and intelligent scheduling
- Thread-safe effect operations with concurrent access protection and atomic updates
- Effect persistence with state restoration and recovery across application sessions
- Integration with reactive systems for automatic UI updates and state synchronization
- Effect middleware with interceptors, transforms, and logging capabilities
- Effect testing utilities with mock effects, assertion helpers, and isolation tools
- Effect analytics with execution tracking, performance monitoring, and usage analysis
- Advanced effect patterns with functional composition and operator-based control flow
- Effect error boundaries with error isolation and recovery strategies

Effect Foundation:
The side effect system provides comprehensive reactive programming support with automatic
dependency management, performance optimization, and debugging capabilities while maintaining
memory efficiency and providing flexible effect patterns for complex UI interactions.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes predictable side effect execution, automatic cleanup, performance optimization,
and developer productivity while providing intelligent scheduling and maintaining optimal
resource usage through automatic dependency management and cleanup strategies.
