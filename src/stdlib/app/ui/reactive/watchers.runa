Native UI Property Watchers and Change Detection System

This module provides comprehensive property watching functionality for native UI applications including:
- Property watchers with automatic change detection and callback execution
- Deep watching with nested object monitoring and recursive change detection
- Shallow watching with top-level property monitoring and performance optimization
- Batch watching with grouped change notifications and efficient update processing
- Debounced watching with configurable delay and noise reduction for high-frequency changes
- Conditional watching with predicate-based change filtering and selective notifications
- Cross-property watching with multi-property dependencies and relationship monitoring
- Performance-optimized change detection with minimal overhead and intelligent comparison
- Memory-efficient watcher management with automatic cleanup and weak reference support
- Thread-safe watching operations with concurrent access protection and atomic updates
- Custom comparison functions with user-defined equality checking and change determination
- Watcher prioritization with execution order control and critical path optimization
- Watch expression evaluation with computed dependencies and dynamic property monitoring
- Watcher debugging tools with change logging, performance analysis, and inspection utilities
- Async watcher support with promise-based callbacks and error handling mechanisms
- Watcher groups with coordinated notifications and batch processing capabilities
- Change history tracking with historical value storage and rollback functionality
- Integration with reactive systems for automatic UI updates and state synchronization
- Watcher analytics with change frequency analysis and performance monitoring
- Advanced watching patterns with functional composition and operator-based filtering

Watcher Foundation:
The property watcher system provides efficient change detection and notification with
comprehensive monitoring capabilities, performance optimization, and debugging support
while maintaining memory efficiency and providing flexible watching patterns for reactive programming.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes efficient change detection, minimal performance overhead, flexible watching
patterns, and developer productivity while providing intelligent change filtering and
maintaining optimal memory usage through automatic cleanup and weak reference management.
