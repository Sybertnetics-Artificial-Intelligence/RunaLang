Native UI Data Binding and Property Synchronization System

This module provides comprehensive data binding functionality for native UI applications including:
- Two-way data binding with automatic synchronization between model and view components
- One-way data binding with source-to-target data flow and change propagation
- Property binding with type-safe value conversion and validation support
- Event binding with declarative event handler attachment and parameter passing
- Binding expressions with complex evaluation, conditional logic, and computed properties
- Value converters with bidirectional data transformation and custom formatting
- Binding contexts with hierarchical data scoping and inheritance patterns
- Performance-optimized binding updates with change detection and selective synchronization
- Cross-component binding with component communication and state sharing
- Template binding with dynamic content generation and conditional rendering
- Collection binding with list synchronization, item templates, and virtualization
- Command binding with action delegation and parameter binding for user interactions
- Binding validation with constraint checking and error reporting mechanisms
- Memory-efficient binding management with automatic cleanup and weak references
- Debug binding tools with binding inspection, performance analysis, and troubleshooting
- Custom binding creation with user-defined binding types and behavior patterns
- Binding animations with smooth transitions and property interpolation during updates
- Thread-safe binding operations with concurrent access protection and atomic updates
- Platform-specific binding optimizations with native control integration and performance tuning
- Binding analytics with usage tracking, performance monitoring, and optimization recommendations

Binding Foundation:
The data binding system provides seamless synchronization between data models and UI
components with comprehensive validation, performance optimization, and debugging
capabilities while maintaining type safety and memory efficiency across binding operations.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes declarative data synchronization, type safety, performance optimization, and
developer productivity while providing flexible binding patterns and maintaining efficient
change detection through intelligent binding graph management and selective updates.
