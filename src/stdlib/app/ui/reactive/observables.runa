Native UI Reactive Observable Data Streams System

This module provides comprehensive observable data stream functionality for native UI applications including:
- Observable stream creation with hot and cold observable patterns and lazy evaluation
- Subject implementations with behavior subjects, replay subjects, and async subjects
- Stream operators with map, filter, reduce, merge, combine, and transformation capabilities
- Subscription management with automatic cleanup, memory leak prevention, and lifecycle handling
- Multicast observables with shared execution and reference counting for performance optimization
- Error handling with retry mechanisms, error recovery, and graceful degradation strategies
- Backpressure handling with buffering, throttling, and flow control for high-frequency data
- Stream composition with complex operator chains and nested observable relationships
- Performance-optimized stream processing with efficient subscription and unsubscription
- Thread-safe observable operations with concurrent access protection and atomic updates
- Integration with UI components for reactive data binding and automatic view updates
- Custom observable creation with user-defined data sources and emission patterns
- Observable debugging tools with stream visualization and subscription tracking
- Memory management with automatic disposal and resource cleanup for long-running streams
- Stream analytics with performance monitoring and usage pattern analysis
- Cross-platform observable support with platform-specific optimizations and native integration
- Observable caching with intelligent memoization and result sharing across subscribers
- Real-time data streaming with WebSocket, Server-Sent Events, and push notification integration
- Observable testing utilities with marble testing, mock observables, and assertion helpers
- Advanced stream patterns with reactive programming paradigms and functional composition

Observable Foundation:
The observable system provides reactive programming foundation with efficient data flow
management, automatic UI synchronization, and comprehensive error handling while maintaining
optimal performance through intelligent subscription management and memory optimization.

Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes reactive programming principles, performance optimization, memory safety, and
developer productivity while providing intuitive stream composition tools and maintaining
efficient data flow through intelligent subscription management and operator optimization.
