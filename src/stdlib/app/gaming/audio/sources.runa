Note:
Audio Source Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides audio source management for 3D and 2D game audio.
Handles sound playback, positioning, and source properties for game audio systems.
Essential for environmental audio and sound effects in games.

Key Features:
- 3D positional audio sources
- 2D stereo audio playback
- Audio streaming for music
- Sound pooling for effects
- Distance attenuation models
- Doppler effect simulation
- Audio source priorities
- Dynamic source allocation
