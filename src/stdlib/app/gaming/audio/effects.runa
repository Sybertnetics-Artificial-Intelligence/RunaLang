Note:
Audio Effects Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides audio effects processing for game sound design.
Supports real-time effects, DSP chains, and environmental audio processing.
Essential for immersive audio experiences in games.

Key Features:
- Reverb and echo effects
- Filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass)
- Distortion and overdrive
- Compression and limiting
- Pitch shifting and time stretching
- Spatial audio processing
- Effect chain management
- Real-time parameter modulation
