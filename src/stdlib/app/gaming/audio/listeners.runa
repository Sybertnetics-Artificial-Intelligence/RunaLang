Note:
Audio Listener Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides audio listener management for 3D spatial audio.
Handles listener positioning, orientation, and properties for accurate 3D sound.
Essential for first-person and third-person audio perspectives in games.

Key Features:
- Listener position and orientation
- Multiple listener support
- Listener velocity for Doppler
- Environmental audio zones
- Occlusion and obstruction
- Reverb zone management
- Listener interpolation
- Audio focus management
