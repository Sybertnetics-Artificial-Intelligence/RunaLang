Note:
Runa Engine Integration Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides the native Runa game engine implementation.
A thin wrapper that coordinates all gaming subsystems into a cohesive engine.
The primary game engine for Runa-based game development.

Key Features:
- Native Runa implementation
- Integrated subsystem management
- Scene graph and entity system
- Physics integration
- Asset pipeline
- Editor support
- Performance profiling
- Cross-platform deployment
