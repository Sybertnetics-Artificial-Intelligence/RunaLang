Note:
Unreal Engine Integration Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides integration points for Unreal Engine interoperability.
Enables Runa code to work within Unreal projects through native modules.
Bridge between Runa gaming framework and Unreal Engine ecosystem.

Key Features:
- Unreal native module interface
- C++ interop layer
- Blueprint integration
- UObject wrappers
- Unreal asset pipeline
- Editor plugin support
- Platform packaging
- Performance optimizations
