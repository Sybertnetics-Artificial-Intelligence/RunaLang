Note:
Custom Engine Integration Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides integration points for custom game engines.
Defines standard interfaces for integrating Runa with any game engine.
Template for building custom engine integrations.

Key Features:
- Generic engine interface
- Plugin architecture
- Message passing system
- Resource sharing protocols
- Event synchronization
- State management
- Performance metrics
- Debug interfaces
