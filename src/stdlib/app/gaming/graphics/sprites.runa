Note:
2D Sprite Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides 2D sprite rendering and animation capabilities.
Supports sprite batching, atlases, animations, and effects for 2D games.
Essential for 2D game graphics and UI rendering.

Key Features:
- Sprite rendering with batching
- Sprite atlas and texture packing
- Frame-based animation playback
- Sprite transformation (scale, rotate, flip)
- Color tinting and blending
- 9-slice scaling for UI
- Sprite sorting and layering
- Particle system integration
