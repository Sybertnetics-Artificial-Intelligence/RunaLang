Note:
3D Mesh Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides 3D mesh handling for game rendering.
Supports mesh loading, manipulation, and rendering for 3D games.
Essential for 3D graphics and model rendering.

Key Features:
- Mesh loading from various formats
- Vertex and index buffer management
- Mesh instancing for performance
- Level-of-detail (LOD) support
- Skeletal mesh support
- Mesh optimization and simplification
- Procedural mesh generation
- Mesh combination and batching
