Note:
Graphics Context Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides graphics context abstraction for rendering operations.
Manages render state, viewport configuration, and graphics API initialization.
Essential foundation for all rendering operations in games.

Key Features:
- Graphics API abstraction (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, Metal)
- Render state management
- Viewport and scissor configuration
- Render target management
- Depth and stencil buffer control
- Blending mode configuration
- Multi-sample anti-aliasing
- Graphics capability queries
