Note:
Shader Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides shader management and compilation for game rendering.
Supports various shader types and provides a uniform interface across graphics APIs.
Essential for advanced rendering effects and GPU programming.

Key Features:
- Shader compilation and linking
- Uniform and attribute management
- Shader hot-reloading
- Compute shader support
- Shader permutation system
- Cross-platform shader translation
- Shader caching and optimization
- Shader debugging utilities
