Note:
Touch Input Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides comprehensive touch input handling for mobile and touchscreen games.
Supports multi-touch, gestures, and touch-specific game controls.
Essential for mobile gaming and touchscreen interfaces.

Key Features:
- Multi-touch point tracking
- Gesture recognition (swipe, pinch, rotate)
- Touch pressure and area detection
- Virtual joystick and button support
- Touch-to-mouse emulation
- Gesture recording and playback
- Touch prediction for low latency
- Palm rejection algorithms
