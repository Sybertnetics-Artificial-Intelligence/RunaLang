Note:
Keyboard Input Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides comprehensive keyboard input handling for games.
Supports key states, combos, remapping, and platform-specific keyboard features.
Essential for PC gaming input with support for international keyboards.

Key Features:
- Key state tracking (pressed, held, released)
- Key combo and sequence detection
- Customizable key bindings and remapping
- Input buffering for fighting games
- Dead zone and repeat rate configuration
- International keyboard layout support
- Text input handling with IME support
- Raw input mode for low-latency response
