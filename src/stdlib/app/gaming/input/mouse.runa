Note:
Mouse Input Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides comprehensive mouse input handling for games.
Supports position tracking, button states, wheel input, and cursor management.
Essential for PC gaming with FPS controls, RTS selection, and UI interaction.

Key Features:
- Mouse position and delta tracking
- Button state management (left, right, middle, extra)
- Mouse wheel and horizontal scroll support
- Cursor locking and hiding for FPS games
- Relative vs absolute mouse modes
- Mouse acceleration and sensitivity
- Drag and drop detection
- Multi-click detection
