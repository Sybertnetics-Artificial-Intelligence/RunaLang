Note:
Gamepad Input Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides comprehensive gamepad/controller input handling.
Supports multiple controllers, haptic feedback, and various gamepad types.
Essential for console gaming and PC games with controller support.

Key Features:
- Multi-controller support (up to 8 simultaneous)
- Button, trigger, and analog stick input
- Haptic feedback and rumble support
- Dead zone configuration for analog inputs
- Controller hot-plugging detection
- Profile support for different controller types
- Input remapping and custom bindings
- Motion control and gyroscope support
