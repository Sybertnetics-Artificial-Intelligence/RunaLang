Game Mathematics Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides specialized mathematical operations optimized for game development.
Includes vector math, quaternions, matrix operations, collision detection primitives,
interpolation functions, and game-specific algorithms. Essential for physics, graphics,
AI, and gameplay calculations with performance-optimized implementations.

Key Features:
- 2D and 3D vector operations with SIMD optimization
- Quaternion mathematics for rotation handling
- Matrix operations for transformations
- Collision detection primitives and algorithms
- Interpolation and easing functions
- Random number generation for games
- Fixed-point arithmetic for deterministic gameplay
- Spatial partitioning and octree operations
- Bezier curves and spline mathematics
- Game-specific algorithms (FOV, line of sight, etc.)

Provides high-performance mathematical operations specifically tailored for
real-time game requirements with both floating-point and fixed-point
implementations for different precision and performance needs.
