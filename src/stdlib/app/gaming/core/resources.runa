Note:
Resource Management Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides comprehensive resource loading, caching, and management for games.
Handles textures, models, sounds, scripts, and all game assets with automatic loading,
reference counting, and memory management. Essential for efficient resource utilization
and preventing memory leaks in resource-intensive games.

Key Features:
- Asynchronous resource loading with progress tracking
- Multi-level caching with LRU eviction policies
- Reference counting and automatic unloading
- Resource hot-reloading for development
- Asset bundling and package management
- Compression and decompression support
- Memory budget management and optimization
- Resource dependencies and loading graphs
- Platform-specific resource variants
- Streaming for large assets

Provides production-ready resource management that scales from mobile games
with strict memory limits to open-world games with gigabytes of assets
while maintaining fast load times and efficient memory usage.
