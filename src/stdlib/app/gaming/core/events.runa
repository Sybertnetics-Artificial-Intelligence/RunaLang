Note:
Game Event System Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides a comprehensive event-driven architecture for game systems.
Implements event dispatching, queuing, prioritization, and subscription management
for decoupled communication between game components. Essential for input handling,
game state changes, achievements, and inter-system communication.

Key Features:
- Type-safe event definition and dispatching system
- Synchronous and asynchronous event handling
- Event queuing with priority and deferred processing
- Event filtering and conditional subscriptions
- Event bubbling and capture phases for UI events
- Event pooling for performance optimization
- Thread-safe event handling for multi-threaded games
- Event recording and replay for debugging
- Network event serialization and synchronization
- Performance profiling for event processing

Provides a robust event system that scales from simple game jam projects
to complex AAA games with hundreds of systems communicating through events
while maintaining type safety and performance.
