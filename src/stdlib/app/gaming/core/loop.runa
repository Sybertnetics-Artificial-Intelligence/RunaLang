Game Loop Module for Game Development Framework

This module provides comprehensive game loop management and timing control for games.
Implements fixed timestep, variable timestep, and semi-fixed timestep game loops with
frame rate control, interpolation, and performance monitoring. Essential foundation
for consistent game logic updates and smooth rendering across different hardware.

Key Features:
- Fixed, variable, and semi-fixed timestep game loop implementations
- Frame rate limiting and V-Sync synchronization support
- Delta time calculation and time accumulation management
- Frame skipping and slowdown detection with adaptive quality
- Performance metrics collection and frame time analysis
- Pause, resume, and time scaling functionality
- Multi-threaded update and render separation
- Interpolation and extrapolation for smooth rendering
- Tick rate control for networked games
- Platform-specific timing optimizations

Provides production-ready game loop patterns that handle edge cases like
long frames, focus loss, and background execution while maintaining
deterministic gameplay and smooth visual presentation.
