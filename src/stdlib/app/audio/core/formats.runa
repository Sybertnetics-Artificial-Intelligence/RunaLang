Format Foundation:
Audio formats provide standardized methods for storing, transmitting, and
processing digital audio data while maintaining compatibility across diverse
systems and applications. Each format represents different trade-offs between
quality, compression, metadata support, and computational requirements.

Codec Architecture:
Implements comprehensive codec management system that handles format detection,
conversion pipelines, and quality optimization while ensuring maximum
compatibility and performance across different audio processing workflows
and platform requirements.
