Streaming Foundation:
Audio streaming enables real-time transmission and processing of audio data
across networks and between processes, providing the infrastructure for
live audio applications, distributed audio systems, and networked audio
processing while maintaining timing accuracy and quality.

Buffer Architecture:
Implements sophisticated buffer management system that handles concurrent
access, memory optimization, and timing-critical operations while ensuring
reliable data flow and minimal latency for real-time audio streaming
applications and distributed processing scenarios.
