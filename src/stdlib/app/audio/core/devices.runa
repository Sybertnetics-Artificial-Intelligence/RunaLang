Device Foundation:
Audio devices serve as the interface between software and hardware audio systems,
providing standardized access to diverse audio hardware while abstracting
platform-specific details and enabling consistent audio processing workflows
across different operating systems and hardware configurations.

Hardware Abstraction:
Implements comprehensive hardware abstraction layer that manages device
discovery, capability negotiation, and resource allocation while ensuring
optimal performance and compatibility across various audio hardware
platforms and driver architectures.
