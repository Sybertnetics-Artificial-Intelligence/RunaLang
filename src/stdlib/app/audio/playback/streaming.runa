Streaming Playback Module

This module provides comprehensive streaming audio playback functionality
for the Runa standard library audio framework. It handles real-time
streaming protocols, adaptive bitrate streaming, stream buffering,
network protocol management, stream quality adaptation, and connection
resilience for various streaming audio services and formats.

Core streaming capabilities include:
- Real-time streaming protocol implementation (HTTP, RTSP, WebRTC)
- Adaptive bitrate streaming with quality negotiation
- Stream buffer management with predictive prefetching
- Network connection handling with automatic reconnection
- Stream metadata processing and dynamic updating
- Multi-format streaming support (HLS, DASH, progressive)
- Bandwidth monitoring and quality adaptation algorithms
- Stream session management with authentication support
- Error recovery mechanisms for stream interruptions
- Live stream handling with low-latency optimization
- Stream analytics and performance monitoring
- Protocol-specific optimization (TCP/UDP selection)
- Stream caching and offline playback preparation
- Multi-bitrate stream switching without interruption
- Stream security handling (DRM, encryption, tokens)

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure to provide
seamless streaming experiences across different network conditions and
streaming protocols. It supports both live and on-demand content with
comprehensive quality of service management.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all streaming operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key streaming protocols supported:
- HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) with variant playlist management
- Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) with MPD parsing
- Progressive HTTP streaming with range request support
- Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) for live content
- WebRTC for low-latency interactive streaming
- Custom streaming protocols with extensible framework
