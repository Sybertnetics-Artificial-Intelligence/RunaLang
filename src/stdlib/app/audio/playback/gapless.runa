Gapless Playback Module

This module provides comprehensive gapless audio playback functionality
for the Runa standard library audio framework. It handles seamless
transitions between audio tracks, crossfading algorithms, track boundary
detection, silence removal, and continuous playback flow management
to eliminate gaps and interruptions between consecutive audio tracks.

Core gapless capabilities include:
- Seamless track transition with zero-gap playback
- Automatic silence detection and removal at track boundaries
- Crossfading algorithms with customizable curves and durations
- Track boundary analysis for optimal transition points
- Pre-buffering and decode-ahead for smooth transitions
- Gapless metadata detection and processing (ReplayGain, etc.)
- Multi-format gapless support across different audio codecs
- Real-time transition smoothing with anti-aliasing
- Album-aware gapless playback for continuous listening
- Dynamic crossfade adjustment based on track characteristics
- Fade-in/fade-out management for natural transitions
- Transition timing optimization for various playback scenarios
- Gapless queue management with lookahead processing
- Audio level matching across tracks for consistent volume
- Spectral analysis for intelligent transition point selection

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure and player
modules to provide professional-grade gapless playback experiences.
It supports both manual crossfade configuration and intelligent
automatic transition detection based on audio content analysis.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all gapless operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key gapless techniques supported:
- Zero-gap concatenation for tracks mastered as continuous
- Intelligent crossfading with frequency-aware blending
- Tempo-matched transitions for rhythmically aligned content
- Dynamic range compression matching across track boundaries
- Acoustic fingerprinting for optimal transition timing
- Real-time analysis of track endings for seamless flow
