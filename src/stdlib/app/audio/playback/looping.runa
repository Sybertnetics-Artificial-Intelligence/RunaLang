Audio Looping Module
This module provides comprehensive audio looping and repeat functionality
for the Runa standard library audio framework. It handles seamless loop
creation, loop point management, nested loop structures, dynamic loop
adjustment, beat-synchronized looping, and advanced loop processing
for creative audio applications and professional playback scenarios.

Core looping capabilities include:
- Seamless audio loop creation with crossfade boundaries
- Precise loop point definition with sample-accurate positioning
- Nested loop structures with hierarchical loop management
- Dynamic loop adjustment during playback without interruption
- Beat-synchronized looping with tempo detection and alignment
- Multi-layer loop processing with independent loop tracks
- Loop fade management for smooth entry and exit transitions
- Automatic loop detection based on audio content analysis
- Loop quantization to musical time divisions and measures
- Variable loop lengths with real-time stretch and compression
- Loop reverse playback with seamless direction changes
- Loop filtering and effects processing within loop boundaries
- Loop recording and overdubbing capabilities
- Loop synchronization across multiple audio sources
- Advanced loop algorithms for creative sound manipulation

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure and playback
modules to provide professional-grade looping functionality for music
production, live performance, and interactive audio applications.
It supports both traditional audio loops and advanced generative loops.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all looping operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key looping techniques supported:
- Crossfade looping with configurable fade curves and durations
- Beat-matched looping with automatic tempo and phase alignment
- Granular looping with micro-loop generation and manipulation
- Spectral looping with frequency-domain loop processing
- Adaptive looping with content-aware loop boundary detection
- Multi-dimensional looping with parameter automation and control
