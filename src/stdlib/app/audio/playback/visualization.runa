Audio Visualization Module
This module provides comprehensive audio visualization and waveform
display functionality for the Runa standard library audio framework.
It handles real-time spectrum analysis, waveform rendering, frequency
domain visualization, spectrogram generation, level meters, and
advanced audio visualization techniques for professional audio applications.

Core visualization capabilities include:
- Real-time waveform rendering with multiple display modes
- FFT-based spectrum analysis with configurable frequency bands
- Spectrogram generation with time-frequency domain representation
- Peak level meters with configurable ballistics and hold times
- VU meters with authentic analog-style response characteristics
- Oscilloscope-style audio signal visualization
- 3D visualization with spatial audio representation
- Waterfall displays for frequency analysis over time
- Phase correlation meters and stereo field visualization
- Harmonic analysis with overtone and fundamental frequency tracking
- Dynamic range visualization with loudness standards compliance
- Multi-channel audio visualization with surround sound support
- Customizable color schemes and visual styling options
- Export capabilities for visualization data and rendered graphics
- Real-time parameter control for interactive visualization adjustment

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure and playback
modules to provide comprehensive visual feedback for audio content.
It supports both real-time visualization during playback and offline
analysis of audio files with high-resolution rendering capabilities.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all visualization operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key visualization techniques supported:
- Time-domain waveform visualization with zoom and pan capabilities
- Frequency-domain spectrum analysis with linear and logarithmic scaling
- Time-frequency spectrograms with configurable window functions
- Multi-resolution analysis with octave and bark scale representations
- Perceptual audio analysis with psychoacoustic modeling
- Machine learning-enhanced visualization with content recognition
