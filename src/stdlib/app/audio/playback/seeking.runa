Audio Seeking Module
This module provides comprehensive audio seeking and navigation functionality
for the Runa standard library audio framework. It handles precise position
seeking, scrubbing operations, bookmark management, timeline navigation,
frame-accurate positioning, and advanced seeking algorithms for various
audio formats and playback scenarios with optimal performance.

Core seeking capabilities include:
- Precise frame-accurate seeking with sample-level positioning
- Fast scrubbing with real-time audio preview during seek operations
- Bookmark and cue point management with metadata support
- Timeline navigation with visual feedback and position tracking
- Multi-format seeking optimization for different audio codecs
- Intelligent seeking algorithms with predictive caching
- Smooth seeking transitions with anti-glitch processing
- Time-based and sample-based position referencing
- Seeking history tracking with undo/redo functionality
- Advanced seeking modes (snap-to-beat, marker-based, etc.)
- Real-time position synchronization across multiple tracks
- Seeking performance optimization with buffer management
- Waveform-assisted seeking with visual position indicators
- Automatic seeking calibration for format-specific requirements
- Seeking accessibility features with keyboard and gesture support

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure and player
modules to provide professional-grade seeking experiences across all
supported audio formats. It handles both streaming and local content
with adaptive seeking strategies based on content characteristics.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all seeking operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key seeking techniques supported:
- Binary search seeking for efficient large-distance navigation
- Linear interpolation for smooth continuous scrubbing
- Predictive prefetching based on seeking patterns
- Format-aware seeking with codec-specific optimizations
- Multi-threaded seeking with background position preparation
- Memory-efficient seeking with minimal buffer disruption
