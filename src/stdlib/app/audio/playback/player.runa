Player Foundation:
Audio players provide centralized control and management for audio content playback
while maintaining high quality reproduction and user experience through efficient
resource management, format compatibility, and intelligent content organization
suitable for both consumer and professional audio applications.

Playback Architecture:
Implements sophisticated playback engine that handles diverse audio formats and
sources while providing seamless user experience through optimized buffering,
format conversion, and real-time processing capabilities with professional-grade
audio quality and performance characteristics.
