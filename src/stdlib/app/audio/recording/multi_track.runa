Multi-Track Recording Module

This module provides comprehensive multi-track audio recording functionality
for the Runa standard library audio framework. It handles simultaneous
recording of multiple audio sources, track management, mixing console
integration, real-time track routing, overdubbing capabilities, and
professional multi-track recording features for studio and live applications.

Core multi-track capabilities include:
- Simultaneous multi-channel recording with independent track control
- Real-time track mixing and routing during recording
- Track grouping and bus assignment for organized workflows
- Independent track processing and effects for each channel
- Track synchronization across multiple recording sources
- Professional punch-in/punch-out recording on individual tracks
- Track comping and take management for multiple recording passes
- Real-time track monitoring with independent headphone mixes
- Track automation recording with parameter capture
- Multi-track overdubbing with existing material playback
- Track isolation and solo capabilities during recording
- Advanced track editing with non-destructive operations
- Multi-track bouncing and stem creation
- Track template system for consistent recording setups
- Professional metering and analysis for each track

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure and capture
modules to provide professional-grade multi-track recording capabilities.
It supports both traditional linear recording and modern loop-based
recording workflows with comprehensive track management.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all multi-track operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key multi-track techniques supported:
- Phase-coherent multi-microphone recording with alignment
- Time-code synchronized recording across multiple devices
- Automatic delay compensation for plugin latency
- Multi-track editing with ripple, roll, and slip editing modes
- Advanced comping with crossfade-based seamless transitions
- Multi-track batch processing and normalization
