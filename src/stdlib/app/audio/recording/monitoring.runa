Audio Monitoring Module

This module provides comprehensive audio monitoring and signal analysis
functionality for the Runa standard library audio framework. It handles
real-time level monitoring, signal quality assessment, headphone
management, monitor mixing, talkback systems, and professional monitoring
features for studio and live recording applications.

Core monitoring capabilities include:
- Real-time level monitoring with peak and RMS detection
- Multi-format metering (VU, PPM, LUFS, dBFS) with standards compliance
- Headphone distribution system with individual mix control
- Monitor speaker management with room correction and calibration
- Talkback system with automatic dim and slate functionality
- Control room monitoring with source selection and switching
- Cue system management for musician communication
- Signal analysis with spectrum display and phase correlation
- Monitor delay compensation for accurate timing reference
- Reference level calibration and loudness monitoring
- Surround sound monitoring with downmix capabilities
- Monitor section automation with scene recall
- Advanced metering with true peak and loudness range measurement
- Monitor path signal processing with EQ and dynamics
- Emergency monitoring systems with backup routing

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure and recording
modules to provide professional-grade monitoring capabilities for
critical listening, recording supervision, and quality control.
It supports both stereo and surround monitoring configurations.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all monitoring operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key monitoring techniques supported:
- Near-field and far-field monitor switching with level matching
- Headphone amplifier management with impedance matching
- Monitor controller integration with external hardware
- Room acoustics compensation with measurement microphone integration
- Multiple monitoring standards compliance (EBU R128, ITU-R BS.1770)
- Advanced correlation metering for stereo and surround content
