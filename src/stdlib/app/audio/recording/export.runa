Audio Export Module

This module provides comprehensive audio export and rendering functionality
for the Runa standard library audio framework. It handles multi-format
audio export, batch processing, metadata embedding, quality optimization,
delivery format preparation, and professional export workflows for
distribution, mastering, and archival purposes.

Core export capabilities include:
- Multi-format audio export with comprehensive codec support
- Batch export processing for multiple files and formats
- Real-time and offline rendering with quality optimization
- Metadata embedding with comprehensive tag support
- Sample rate and bit depth conversion with high-quality algorithms
- Stem and multitrack export for mixing and mastering workflows
- Delivery format preparation with platform-specific optimization
- Audio mastering integration with loudness normalization
- Export templates and presets for consistent workflows
- Quality analysis and validation of exported audio
- Automatic file naming and organization systems
- Export progress monitoring with detailed status reporting
- Network export capabilities for cloud and remote delivery
- Export security with encryption and access control
- Archive format creation with comprehensive metadata preservation

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure and recording
modules to provide professional-grade export capabilities for all
stages of audio production, from rough mixes to final masters
with comprehensive format support and quality control.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all export operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key export techniques supported:
- High-quality sample rate conversion with anti-aliasing
- Advanced dithering algorithms for bit depth reduction
- Parallel processing for fast batch export operations
- Content-aware export optimization based on audio characteristics
- Format-specific optimization for streaming and broadcast delivery
- Professional mastering chain integration with export pipeline
