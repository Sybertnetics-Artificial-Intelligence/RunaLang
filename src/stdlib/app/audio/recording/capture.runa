Audio Capture Module

This module provides comprehensive audio capture and recording functionality
for the Runa standard library audio framework. It handles real-time audio
input from various sources, multi-channel recording, input monitoring,
format conversion, automatic gain control, noise reduction, and professional
recording features for high-quality audio capture across different devices.

Core capture capabilities include:
- Multi-device audio input with simultaneous recording support
- Real-time input monitoring with zero-latency feedback
- Automatic input level adjustment and gain control
- Multi-format recording with real-time format conversion
- Input source selection and routing with device management
- Audio input analysis with signal quality assessment
- Recording session management with metadata embedding
- Buffer management for reliable capture without dropouts
- Input synchronization across multiple audio sources
- Professional recording features (punch-in/out, take management)
- Advanced input processing (noise reduction, filtering, EQ)
- Input device calibration and latency compensation
- Recording automation with trigger-based capture
- Multi-channel input mapping and channel assignment
- Input metering and signal visualization during capture

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure to provide
professional-grade audio capture capabilities. It supports both consumer
audio interfaces and professional recording equipment with comprehensive
control over input parameters and recording quality.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all capture operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key capture techniques supported:
- Low-latency capture with ASIO and CoreAudio driver integration
- High-resolution audio recording up to 32-bit/192kHz sampling
- Adaptive buffer sizing based on system performance and latency requirements
- Multi-threaded capture architecture for optimal performance
- Real-time audio processing pipeline with plugin architecture
- Automatic format detection and conversion for seamless workflow
