Audio Overdubbing Module

This module provides comprehensive audio overdubbing and layering
functionality for the Runa standard library audio framework. It handles
punch-in/punch-out recording, seamless overdub layers, take management,
automatic punch recording, overdub synchronization, and professional
overdubbing features for creative and corrective audio recording.

Core overdubbing capabilities include:
- Seamless punch-in/punch-out recording with crossfade boundaries
- Multiple overdub layer management with independent processing
- Automatic punch recording based on audio detection and triggers
- Take compilation and comping with smooth transitions
- Overdub synchronization with existing audio material
- Real-time monitoring during overdub with latency compensation
- Advanced timing correction and alignment for overdub layers
- Loop-based overdubbing with cycle recording capabilities
- Overdub automation with parameter recording during performance
- Non-destructive overdubbing with unlimited undo/redo functionality
- Overdub template system for consistent recording workflows
- Advanced overdub editing with region-based operations
- Overdub analysis and quality assessment tools
- Multi-format overdub support across different audio codecs
- Professional overdub metering and visualization feedback

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure, capture,
and multi-track modules to provide professional-grade overdubbing
capabilities for music production, post-production, and audio editing
workflows with comprehensive take management and editing tools.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all overdubbing operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key overdubbing techniques supported:
- Smart punch recording with automatic boundary detection
- Spectral overdubbing with frequency-selective recording
- Time-aligned overdubbing with automatic delay compensation
- Dynamic overdubbing with real-time parameter adjustment
- Collaborative overdubbing with multi-user session management
- Content-aware overdubbing with intelligent placement algorithms
