Audio Compression Module

This module provides comprehensive audio compression and dynamics processing
functionality for the Runa standard library audio framework. It handles
real-time compression, limiting, expansion, gating, multi-band dynamics,
advanced compression algorithms, and professional dynamics control for
recording, mixing, and mastering applications.

Core compression capabilities include:
- Real-time audio compression with configurable attack and release
- Multi-band compression with independent frequency band processing
- Peak limiting with lookahead and oversampling for broadcast compliance
- Noise gating with sophisticated gate timing and hysteresis
- Expansion and downward expansion for dynamic range enhancement
- Vintage-style compression modeling with analog characteristics
- Parallel compression with wet/dry blending capabilities
- Sidechain compression with external trigger source support
- Adaptive compression with program-dependent parameter adjustment
- De-essing with frequency-selective compression algorithms
- Transient shaping with attack and sustain component control
- Advanced metering with gain reduction and compression visualization
- Compression automation with real-time parameter modulation
- Multi-channel compression with linked and independent operation
- Professional loudness control with broadcast standards compliance

This module integrates with the core audio infrastructure and recording
modules to provide professional-grade dynamics processing capabilities
for all stages of audio production, from tracking through mastering
with comprehensive control over dynamic range characteristics.

Implementation follows the Runa skeleton pattern with complete type
definitions and function signatures for all compression operations.
All functions include proper error handling and follow established
patterns from the core audio infrastructure modules.

Key compression techniques supported:
- VCA, FET, optical, and tube compression modeling
- Adaptive release compression with program-dependent timing
- Spectral compression with frequency-aware processing
- Multi-stage compression with cascaded processing chains
- Intelligent compression with content analysis and adaptation
- High-resolution compression with 64-bit internal processing
