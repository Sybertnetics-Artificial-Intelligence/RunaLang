Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Onset Detection Analysis Module

This module provides comprehensive onset detection capabilities for professional audio
applications. It includes various onset detection algorithms, spectral flux analysis,
energy-based detection, phase-based detection, and complex domain methods for
accurate identification of note onsets, transients, and musical events.

The module supports real-time processing with low-latency detection, adaptive
thresholding, and multi-band onset analysis. All processing maintains professional
audio quality with support for various musical styles and instrument types including
percussive, harmonic, and complex polyphonic material.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
onset detection, intelligent adaptation algorithms, and real-time performance
analysis without embedded AI processing.
