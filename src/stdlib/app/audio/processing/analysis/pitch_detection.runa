Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Pitch Detection Analysis Module

This module provides comprehensive pitch detection and fundamental frequency estimation
capabilities for professional audio applications. It includes various pitch detection
algorithms, autocorrelation methods, frequency domain techniques, and advanced
multi-pitch detection systems for both monophonic and polyphonic audio signals.

The module supports real-time processing with low-latency detection, confidence
estimation, and robust handling of noisy signals. All processing maintains
professional audio quality with support for various musical instruments,
vocal analysis, and complex harmonic content.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
pitch analysis, intelligent tracking algorithms, and adaptive processing
capabilities without embedded AI processing.
