Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Loudness Analysis Module

This module provides comprehensive loudness measurement and analysis capabilities
for professional audio applications. It includes various loudness standards
(EBU R128, ITU-R BS.1770, LUFS, LKFS), perceptual loudness models, dynamic
range analysis, and real-time loudness monitoring with accurate metering.

The module supports broadcast standards compliance, mastering applications,
and perceptual audio analysis. All processing maintains professional audio
quality with support for various channel configurations and international
loudness standards for broadcast, streaming, and production environments.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
loudness analysis, intelligent level management, and adaptive processing
capabilities without embedded AI processing.
