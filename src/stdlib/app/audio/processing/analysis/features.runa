Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Audio Feature Extraction Module

This module provides comprehensive audio feature extraction capabilities for
professional audio applications. It includes spectral features, temporal features,
perceptual features, and advanced descriptors for music information retrieval,
audio classification, and content analysis applications.

The module supports real-time feature extraction with configurable analysis
windows, multi-scale analysis, and robust feature normalization. All processing
maintains professional audio quality with support for various audio types
including music, speech, environmental sounds, and complex audio scenes.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
feature analysis, intelligent feature selection, and adaptive processing
capabilities without embedded AI processing.
