Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Audio Classification Analysis Module

This module provides comprehensive audio classification capabilities for professional
audio applications. It includes genre classification, instrument recognition,
speech/music discrimination, event detection, and content analysis systems
with robust feature-based classification and pattern recognition algorithms.

The module supports real-time classification with confidence estimation,
hierarchical classification systems, and multi-label classification. All
processing maintains professional audio quality with support for various
audio types and classification taxonomies for broadcast, production, and
analysis applications.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
classifiers, intelligent adaptation algorithms, and training interfaces
without embedded AI processing.
