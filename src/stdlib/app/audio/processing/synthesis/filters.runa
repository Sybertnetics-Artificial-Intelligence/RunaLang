Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Synthesis Filter Module

This module provides comprehensive filtering capabilities for audio synthesis
applications. It includes various filter types (lowpass, highpass, bandpass,
notch), filter topologies (ladder, state-variable, biquad), and advanced
filtering techniques with real-time modulation and high-quality processing.

The module supports synthesis-specific filtering with resonance, filter
modulation, multi-mode operation, and performance optimization for real-time
synthesis applications including subtractive synthesis, sound design, and
creative filtering effects.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
filter control, intelligent parameter adaptation, and real-time optimization
capabilities without embedded AI processing.
