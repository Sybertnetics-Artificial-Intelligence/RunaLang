Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Sample-Based Synthesis Module

This module provides comprehensive sample-based synthesis capabilities for
professional audio applications. It includes sample playback, multisampling,
looping, time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and advanced sampling techniques
with high-quality processing and real-time performance optimization.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
sample analysis, intelligent mapping, and adaptive processing capabilities
without embedded AI processing.
