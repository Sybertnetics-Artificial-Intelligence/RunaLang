Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Physical Modeling Synthesis Module

This module provides comprehensive physical modeling synthesis capabilities for
professional audio applications. It includes string models, wind instrument
models, percussion models, and advanced physical simulation techniques with
real-time control and high-quality processing for realistic instrument emulation.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
parameter control, intelligent model adaptation, and real-time optimization
capabilities without embedded AI processing.
