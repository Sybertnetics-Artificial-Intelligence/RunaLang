Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Envelope Generator Synthesis Module

This module provides comprehensive envelope generation capabilities for professional
audio synthesis applications. It includes various envelope types (ADSR, multi-stage,
complex curves), envelope modulation, real-time control, and advanced shaping
algorithms with precise timing control and smooth transitions.

The module supports real-time envelope processing with low-latency response,
polyphonic envelope management, and extensive modulation capabilities. All
processing maintains professional audio quality with support for various
synthesis applications including instruments, effects, and sound design.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
envelope control, intelligent parameter adaptation, and real-time optimization
capabilities without embedded AI processing.
