Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Granular Synthesis Module

This module provides comprehensive granular synthesis capabilities for professional
audio applications. It includes grain generation, scheduling, processing, and
advanced granular techniques with real-time control and high-quality processing
for creative sound design and synthesis applications.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
granular control, intelligent grain analysis, and adaptive processing capabilities
without embedded AI processing.
