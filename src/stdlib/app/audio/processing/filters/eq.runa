- Professional filter algorithms (Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic)
- Anti-aliasing and oversampling support for high-quality processing

Technical Foundation:
Implements advanced digital filter design algorithms, biquad cascades,
and frequency domain processing optimized for sample-accurate audio
processing with minimal phase distortion and computational efficiency.

Applications:
Essential for mixing and mastering, live sound reinforcement,
broadcast audio, podcast production, and any application requiring
precise frequency domain control and professional audio quality.
