Runa Standard Library - Audio Processing - Pitch Shifting and Time Stretching Module

This module provides comprehensive pitch manipulation and time-stretching capabilities
for professional audio applications. It includes phase vocoder algorithms, granular
synthesis techniques, and advanced pitch detection and correction systems with
high-quality time-domain and frequency-domain processing methods.

The module supports real-time processing with low-latency algorithms, formant
preservation, and artifact-free pitch manipulation. All processing maintains
professional audio quality with support for polyphonic material and various
musical applications including auto-tuning and creative pitch effects.

Architecture follows AI-ready design patterns with hooks for machine learning
pitch analysis, intelligent correction algorithms, and real-time adaptation
capabilities without embedded AI processing.
