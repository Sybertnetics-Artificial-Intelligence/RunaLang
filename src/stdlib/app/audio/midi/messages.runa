Key Features:
- Complete MIDI specification support with MIDI 1.0, MIDI 2.0, and MPE compatibility
- Type-safe message handling using Runa's type system for reliable MIDI data processing
- Declarative message patterns with intention-revealing message construction and processing
- Performance-optimized algorithms with efficient message parsing and high-throughput processing
- Comprehensive message validation with format checking and specification compliance
- Modern MIDI capabilities with high-resolution data, per-note controllers, and extended addressing
- Integration-ready architecture with hooks for custom message processing and transformation
- Standards-compliant implementation with MIDI Manufacturers Association specifications

MIDI Message Foundation:
Built on comprehensive MIDI message principles with complete specification
coverage, performance optimization, and extensibility to provide reliable
MIDI message processing with accurate parsing, generation, and
transformation across diverse MIDI applications and protocols.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized for high-throughput MIDI processing with efficient message parsing,
minimal memory allocation, and smart caching to ensure real-time MIDI
performance while supporting complex message transformations and
high-frequency MIDI data streams with microsecond-precision timing.
