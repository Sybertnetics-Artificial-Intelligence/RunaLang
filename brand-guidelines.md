# Runa™ Brand and Trademark Guidelines

Hello! We're excited that you're interested in the Runa programming language. We've open-sourced Runa to empower the community to build amazing things with it. To help us protect the project's identity and ensure that users know where to find official information, we've created these guidelines for using the Runa name and logo.

Our goal is to keep this process simple and clear, not to bog you down with legal complexities.

## The Runa™ Name

"Runa" is the name of our programming language, created and maintained by Sybertnetics Artificial Intelligence Solutions. While the Runa source code is available under the Apache 2.0 license, the "Runa" brand and name are the property of Sybertnetics.

### Permitted Uses (Things You Can Do Freely)

We want to make it easy to talk about Runa. You do **not** need our permission to:

✅ Write a book, blog post, or tutorial about the Runa language.  
✅ Create a free or commercial application or library using Runa.  
✅ Use "Runa" to describe your software's compatibility (e.g., "Works with Runa," "For the Runa language").  
✅ Create a user group, community forum, or social media account for Runa (e.g., "Runa Users of New York").  
✅ Honestly and accurately state your expertise with Runa (e.g., "Runa development consultant").  
✅ Use the Runa name in academic papers or for educational purposes.

### Restricted Uses (Things That Require Permission)

To avoid confusion, some uses of the Runa name require a partnership or a separate license agreement with Sybertnetics. Please contact us before doing any of the following:

❌ **Do not use "Runa" in the name of your company, product, or service.**
    *   For example, avoid names like "RunaCloud," "Runa Performance Pro," or "Runa Systems Inc."
    *   This is the most common source of confusion. Using a name like "CloudPro for Runa" is a great alternative.

❌ **Do not create products or services that imply an official endorsement or partnership.**
    *   Avoid names like "Official Runa Training" or "Runa Certified Hosting."
    *   We plan to launch our own official certification and partnership programs in the future. If you're interested in partnering with us, please reach out!

❌ **Do not use "Runa" in your top-level domain name.**
    *   For example, avoid `runahosting.com`.

❌ **Do not modify the Runa logo or use it as your own product's logo.**
